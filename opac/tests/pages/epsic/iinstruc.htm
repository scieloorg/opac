        a) <b><i>Empirical  studies:</i></b> original research reports. It should include secondary  analyzes in order to <b>test hypotheses,  presenting new data analyzes that was not shown or considered in previous works</b>.  They are typically organized to reflect the stages of the research process in  the following order: introduction, method, results, discussion, conclusions.<br>
        b) <b>Theoretical studies: </b>proposition of  theoretical advances based on the existing empirical literature. Authors should  present the <b>development<strong> of</strong> a theory to  expand or refine theoretical constructs, present a new theory or analyze an  existing theory, showing its weaknesses or demonstrating the advantage of a  theory over another.</b> The contributions of this nature analyze the internal  consistency of a theory, as well as its external validity. The presentation of  the sections may vary according to their content (differently from the  empirical studies).<br>
        c) <b>Critical literature reviews</b>:  consist on a critical evaluation of published material, which may include  research syntheses and Meta-analyzes. For Meta-analyzes, authors should use  quantitative procedures to statistically adjust the results of other studies.<b> The authors should integrate and evaluate  previously published material, considering the progress of research and seeking  to clarify a specific problem.</b> Therefore, the problem must be clearly  defined, prior information should be summarized to inform the reader about the  state of the research, if there are relations, contradictions, gaps and/or  inconsistencies in literature, and new research directions in order to solve  the identified problems should be suggested. The text components can be  arranged in several ways, but have to be consistent.      </p>
      <p>Manuscripts must be submitted by internet, exclusively through the website

        edition resources, like control marks, special hyphenation or macros, 

        will not be accepted.</p>

      <p>Here below are the features to be followed in formatting the manuscript:</p>

      <ul>

        <li> Formatting: 

          <blockquote> 

            <p>Size of the sheet: A4.<br>

              Margins: 3.0 cm on the left; other margins of 2.0cm, with alignment 

              to the left.<br>

              Page numbers: indicated in Arabic numbers, on the upper left corner 

              of the page.<br>

              Font: Times New Roman, font size 12;<br>

              Double-space the whole document, including <i>resumo</i>, abstract, <i>resumen</i>, list of references, 

              notes and appendices. See below for standards applicable to tables 

              charts and figures.</p>

          </blockquote>

        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>It is fundamentally important for the material not to contain any identification 

        of authorship, including reference to previous works by the author(s), 

        method details enabling identification/localization of origin, as well 

        as information contained in the fields of file properties of the document, 

        in order not to invalidate the process of blind review by peers. To erase 

        author properties in file properties you must go to "File" -&gt; 

        "Properties" in versions of Microsoft Office Word&#174;older 

        than version 2007, and to "File" -&gt; "Prepare" -&gt; 

        "Properties" in <i>Microsoft Office Word</i>&#174;2007.</p>

      <p>2. The initial pages must contain:</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <ol type="a">

          <li>the title of the manuscript in Portuguese - must be concise and informative (maximum 20 words) - should reflect the  content of the manuscript;</li>

          <li>a suggestion for an abbreviated title in Portuguese is required;</li>

          <li>abstract in Portuguese, with 100 words at least and 150 words at 

            most in the case of articles  (empirical studies, theoretical studies and critical reviews);</li>

          <li>indication of three to five keywords in Portuguese, in lowercase, 

            separated by semicolon, as described in the subject descriptors available 

            at the <i>Biblioteca Virtual em Sa&uacute;de</i> (BVS-Psi ULAPSI Brasil) 

            <a href="http://www.bvs-psi.org.br/" target="_blank">http://www.bvs-psi.org.br/</a>;</li>

          <li>title of the manuscript in English (translation of the title in 

            Portuguese);</li>

          <li>abstract (translation of the abstract into English);</li>

          <li>indication of three to five keywords in English (translated from 

            the keywords in Portuguese), in lower case, separated by semicolon 

            and following the same rules described for Portuguese.</li>
          <li>title of the manuscript in <b>Spanish</b> (translation of the title in  Portuguese);</li>
          <li>resumen (translation of the <i>resumo</i> into Spanish);</li>
          <li>three to five palabras  clave (translation of <i>palavras-chave</i> into Spanish), lowercase, separated by a semicolon, obeying the same  descriptors as for the <i>resumo</i> in  Portuguese.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Note: the initial pages are part of the continuous text, with no need to  be submitted on separate sheets (e.g., the English title, abstract and keywords  should be added just under the <i>palavras-chave</i> of the <i>resumo</i> in Portuguese and so  on). </b></p>
      </ol>

      <p>3. The page limits described below include <b>all</b> elements of the manuscript (titles, <i>resumo</i>, abstract, <i>resumen</i>, text, tables, figures, references, notes and appendices):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>26  pages for articles (empirical studies, theoretical studies and critical reviews  of literature).</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>4. As previously indicated,tables, charts and figures must be 

        included in the body of the text, after the bibliographic references, 

        one on each page (taking into account the maximum number of pages allowed 

        for each category). Its preparation must respect the following standards: 

        black and white, font size 10, single-lined and never exceeding the size 

        of 17.5 x 23.5 cm. As they are included at the end of the document sent, 

        it is necessary to indicate, in the body of the text, the approximate 

        location where they are to be placed. It is extremely important  that, in the case of tables and charts, they are set in Word (or similar) and  that they are not saved as pictures, if there is need of edition. In case of  figures, the same should be included in the file in a copy-paste form (the  command &quot;insert&quot; should not be used).</p>

        <p>Keller (2002) states that  the first task of a child's development is to develop learning relationships with  primary caregivers, and he conceptualizes learning as:</p>



          <p>a development process,  guided by epigenetic rules that direct babies' attention for their social  partners and allow an easier learning of the parameters that define the  relationships within a particular context, and consequently the development of  a self-context (p. 217).</p>



        <p>According to Souza and  Paiva (2013), &quot;Youth is not a concept that is given, but several concepts  that are the result of a specific historical representation of this&rdquo; (p. 353).</p>

      <p>9. Any additional material considered indispensable for understanding 

        the text (questionnaires, interview protocols, tests, etc.) or too large 

        tables must go as Appendices, in new pages, identified by uppercase letters

      <p>Manuscripts fitting the modalities specified above, and rigorously following 

        the criteria for manuscript submission, will be subjected to the following 

        process:</p>

      <p>1. Preliminary evaluation: - Quality and pertinence of the manuscript 

        with the thematic axes of interest of the Journal will be evaluated, considering 

        originality and theoretic-methodological coherence, and in terms of the 

        section to which the manuscript was sent. Such evaluation will be made 

        by the editorial in charge of <i>Estudos de Psicologia (Natal)</i> and, 

        eventually, by a member of the Editorial Commission of the Journal, and 

        might eventually result in <b>rejection</b>.</p>

      <p>2. Initial verification:The full compliance of the manuscript to the 

        following requirements will be checked:</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>To be free of any identification of authorship;</li>

        <li>Format (see item 1 of these instructions);</li>

        <li>Requirements for the initial pages (see item 2 of these instructions);</li>

        <li>To comply with the norms of the 6th edition (2010) of the Publication 

          Manual of theAmerican Psychological Association (APA), for all the body 

          of the manuscript, including the list of references;</li>

        <li>To have the correct number of pages indicated for the section to which 

          it was submitted (including abstracts, list of references, tables and 

          figures).</li>

      </ol>

      <p>Noncompliance of <b>any</b> of these five items is enough for an <b>INITIAL 

        REJECTION</b> of the work, for what we recommend the authors to carefully 

        check their manuscripts before submission. We emphasize that manuscripts 

        <b>REJECTED TWICE</b> for noncompliance to these items are not to be received 

        again for a period of 12 (twelve) months from the date of refusal.</p>

      <p>3. Peerevaluation: after evaluation of the abovementioned items, the 

        manuscript will be submitted to a minimum of two peer reviewers, members 

        of the Scientific Conceal of the Journal and/or <i>ad hoc</i> consultants, 

        with the following possibilities:</p>

      <ul>

        <li> Not recommended for publication (inappropriate forEstudos de Psicologia)</li>

        <li> Not recommended for publication, but encouraged to be reformulated 

          for a new submission</li>

        <li>Recommended for publication, but needing revision</li>

        <li>Recommended for publication, without the need of revision</li>

      </ul>

      <p>4. Notification  to authors: after peer review, the authors will receive 

        one of the following decisions:</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>Preliminary editorial decision: a notification recommending reformulation, 

          with a deadline of 21 days and making available integral copies of the peer 

          revisions, hiding the identity of the consultants. Reformulated manuscripts 

          are to be examined by the <b>Editorial Commission</b>, which will decide, 

          on the basis of the consultant&#146;s recommendations, the <b>acceptance</b> 

          for publication, the need for additional reformulation, or even the 

          refusal. In case of acceptance, the Editorial Commission has <b>the 

          right to make some little modifications into the manuscript, for standardization 

          purposes</b>, according to the editorial parameters of the Journal.</li>

        <li><b>Final</b> Editorial decision: a notification of the final decision about publishing 

          the manuscript, always made by the Editorial Commission.</li>

      </ol>

      <p>We emphasize that the peer evaluation process uses the double blind review 

        system, which hides the identity of authors and consultants. It is for 

        this reason that the authorship of the manuscript being not revealed is 

        an indispensable criterion for starting the evaluation process.</p>
      <p>There is no fee for submission and review articles.</p></td>
