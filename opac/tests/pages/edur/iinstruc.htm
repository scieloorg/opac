    <p><strong>Educação  em Revista </strong>is an open access electronic periodic of  continuous publication, that has the goal to disseminate unprecedented  scientific production in the Educational field. Manuscripts can be presented in  Portuguese, English and Spanish.</p>
    <p>The magazine is organized in five  sessions:</p>
    <ol start="1" type="a">
      <li><strong>Articles:</strong> gathers unpublished manuscripts       that present empirical or theoretical research results, or systematic and       integrative scientific and academic production’s critic review.</li>
      <li><strong>Reviews: </strong>gathers manuscripts that present       critical reading of relevant works to the Educational field that has been       published in the last two years.<strong></strong></li>
      <li><strong>Palavra aberta (Open word):</strong> gathers opinion articles about current topics of repercussion in       the Educational field.</li>
      <li><strong>Interviews: </strong>gathers unpublished interviews that present relevant contributions       to the Educational field.</li>
      <li><strong>Dossier: </strong>gathers a set of articles that address a specific theme, conceived       from proposals coming from the academic community or from open call       organized by the editors.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Educação em Revista values originality in the submitted  manuscripts, its importance to researchers in the Educational field,  theoretical-methodological rigour, quality and relevance of evidence that  support arguments developed by authors.<br>
      Manuscripts submitted to <strong>Educação em Revista</strong> are previously evaluated by the Editorial  Commission. Those who answer editorial criteria are then sent to double-blind  peer review. Evaluators must have a doctorate title and belong to a national or  international scientific institution. The author’s, evaluator’s and  institution’s names will remain in secret during the whole process. The  magazine will publish its <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers’  names annually.<br>
      Manuscripts that don’t attend the magazine’s editorial  criteria will be returned to the authors. In this group are the works that  aren’t original; aren’t centrally about an educational area problem; are merely  descriptive, without developing a theoretical or methodological analysis of its  thematic approach; are experience narratives; don’t present relevant  contribution to the analysis of its thematic approach; don’t present empiric  elements or arguments sufficiently developed that fundament its analysis and  conclusions.<br>
      Editorial Commission might publish an  article produced by invitation, with the aim to contribute to an urgent debate  in the field. These article will only be subject of evaluation by the Editorial  Commission.  <br>
      Each  author can only have one manuscript in evaluation, from the beginning of  submission to final publishing. </p>
It will be observed a two-year interval between publication of a  manuscript written by the same author and the beginning of a new submission  process.</td>
