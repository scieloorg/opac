   <p>The Center for Science and Mathematics Education &ndash; CECIMIG (<a href="www.fae.ufmg/cecimig" target="_blank">www.fae.ufmg/cecimig</a>), a center for science education research and outreach at the Faculty of Education at UFMG, is responsible for the publication of <strong>Ensaio Research in Science Education</strong> (e-ISSN 1983-2117). The journal relies on the support of the Post-Graduate Education Program at UFMG (Level 7 at Capes)], whose editors are active professors.</p>
   <p>The Journal publishes original research articles (empirical research reports or theoretical essays), articles of literature review (state of the art), and book reviews with themes of interest for the field of science education research. The journal seeks to attend to criteria of academic accuracy and social and educational relevance.</p>
   <p><strong>Policy &amp; Standards</strong></p>
   <p>Works submitted to the publication should be original and cannot be under consideration by another publication vehicle (book or journal). Papers presented in conferences can be submitted if rewritten and expanded, thus avoiding repeat publication of identical works in conference proceedings.</p>
   <p><strong>Ensaio</strong> primarily publishes articles in Portuguese; however, manuscripts written in Spanish or English may be published without translation if submitted by foreign authors.</p>
   <p>Authors are responsible for the originality and veracity of the content presented in each work. Linguistic review must be completed prior to submission of the manuscript.</p>
   <p><strong>Peer review</strong></p>
   <p>Theoretical articles should introduce new concepts to their particular field of knowledge, while bringing conclusions and implications for research and educational practice in the area of science education. Empirical articles should present data that, from a theoretical perspective, result in new knowledge or new applications in different contexts.</p>
   <p>Due to the interdisciplinary nature of science education research, which is fed by theories from other fields of research &ndash; epistemology, psychology, linguistics, sociology of knowledge, sociology of education, philosophy and history of science, among others &ndash; and from the interface with education research as a whole, <strong>Ensaio Research in Science Education</strong> publishes works from these fields in the condition of having a connection with what is being produced in the field of science education, as well as bringing relevant results to the field.</p>
   <p>Authors should indicate if the research is financed and if there are any conflicts of interest. Prior to publication, in the case of ethical considerations, the Editorial Board  may request a copy of the research acceptance. If the submission is accepted, the authors should forward the signed authorization, providing copyrights to <strong>Ensaio Research in Science Education</strong>, agreeing to the publication of the article in both print and electronic formats.</p>
   <p>Works should be written according to ABNT standards.</p>
   <p>The lead author will be notified that the manuscript was received within two weeks of submission. Following an initial analysis of the submitted work, the manuscript will be sent, without identifying the authors, to two reviewers who are specialists in the field in question. In the case of differences of opinion between them, a third reviewer will be consulted. Notification of the final position on the submission will be sent to the authors, with a copy of the reviewers' reports.</p>
   <p>All the reviewers have PhD in the area of education/science education and meet the following criteria: 1. They have competencies related to the submitted article; 2. They do not have links with the institutions or research groups of the submitting authors.</p>
   <p>The editors are committed to monitoring the process such that quality reports are provided in timely manner. If a report is dependent on modifications to the text, the author will have 30 days to send the changes, otherwise the manuscript will be archived. The average time between submission and approval has historically been nine months. There has been an effort made to reduce this period of time. Approved works will integrate the numbers of the journal, prioritizing the submission and approval dates, as well as the regional distribution criteria of the authors. The final texts are laid out and reviewed (language, spelling and technical standards), and submitted to the authors for final verification prior to eletronic publication on the journal.</p>
   <p><strong>Target audience</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Ensaio Research in Science Education</strong> publishes original research articles (empirical research reports or theoretical trials) of interest to the field of science education, serving the needs of researchers and post-graduate students in the areas of Science Education, Natural Sciences Education (Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Geosciences and Astronomy), and Health and Environmental Education. It also targets undergraduate students and graduate students in the area of Natural Sciences, and related fields, as well as other primary education professionals who are involved with science education.</p>
   <p><strong>Peer review process</strong></p>
   <p><strong>1. Receipt of submission</strong></p>
   <p>a) The journal's Managing Editor verifies the formal aspects of the text (summary and abstract; sections; quotes and references; tables, graphs and images, etc.). He also confirms the originality of the text, ensuring it does not make direct or indirect reference to the authors. If any errors or problems are identified, the authors are contacted and a new version of the text is submitted.<br>
     b) The Editor-in-Chief, or one of the Associated Editors, does a preliminary analysis of the submission with a view to verifying if the topic and approach fit within the scope of the journal. If approved, he or she assumes the role of editor for that particular submission, holding responsibility for the completion of next steps. For submissions previously not approved for reasons of inadequacy, the final decision will be made by the editors.</p>
   <p><strong>2. Selection of reviewers</strong></p>
   <p>a) The editor chooses two reviewers for each submitted text according to the following criteria: 1. Researchers with recognized competency in the area of the work; 2. Researchers which do not have any institutional affiliation or links with the work groups/research projects of the submitting authors.</p>
   <p><strong>3. Evaluation Monitoring</strong></p>
   <p>a) If the reviewers do not respond regarding their availability to evaluate the work, the editor will consult them via email. If no response is received, or if they are unavailable, another reviewer will be invited to work on the submission.<br>
     b) At the end of the indicated deadline (4 weeks), the editor sends a reminder to the reviewer(s) about their commitment. If this does not happen in the following 4 weeks, the reviewer is contacted. If there is no commitment to meeting the deadlines for the completion of the report, the request is cancelled and another reviewer is immediately invited to participate in the submission.<br>
   c) In the new evaluation round, the same procedures are followed.</p>
   <p><strong>4. Editorial decision</strong></p>
   <p>a) If the reports received are convergent, the editor sends a letter to the lead author of the submission, communicating the editorial decision - accepted, rejected, corrections required, resubmit or send to another journal.<br>
   b) If the reports received are divergent, the problem will be taken to the editorial team, which can make a decision as intermediary, or whenever possible, will send to a third reviewer. In this case, the selection of the third reviewer is made by the Editorial Team.<br>
   c) The editors should take care that any rejections be justified. If the reports indicate rejection of a work without providing justified reasons for such a decision, the editor should request justification from the reviewer or solicit a new revision.<br>
   d) Works accepted with necessary corrections should be evaluated by the editor. They should be sent to the editors with a letter that indicates the points revisited and justifying the recommendations of the reviewers that had not been addressed. Based on the analysis of these documents, the editor will prepare the final report for the submission.</p>
   <p><strong>5. Editing and publication</strong></p>
   <p>a) Accepted and approved works are entered into a spreadsheet. The Editorial Team will choose the articles to be published in upcoming editions of the journal. The following criteria is considered: Submission and acceptance dates of the works (with priority given to older articles); Regional distribution for the authors of works to be published in each number of the Journal; 3. Distribution of works by foreign authors; 4. Possibility of a dossier with similar topics among published works.</p>
