      <p>The journal publishes original articles of pure and applied research 

        that have to do with Entomology. It is dedicated to the study of vectors 

        of human and veterinary diseases, pests of cultivated plants of economic 

        interest, paying special attention to geographic and climatological aspects 

        that have to do with Entomology. Articles on history of Entomology including 

        bibliographies of distinguished entomologists are also welcome. An aim 

        is to distribute scientific information from and to researchers, professors, 

        undergraduate and postgraduate students and all people interested in the 

        field of Entomology. The Editorial board is composed of 33 effective professional 

        members from different research and training institutes proficient in 

        different areas of Entomology. Ad hoc reviewers are invited to analyze 

        papers and give competent opinion every year. The articles are usually 

        sent to two reviewers specialized in corresponding particular field. In 

        case of discrepancy of opinions among the two, a third reviewer is invited 

        to give his opinion. Assessing referees are free to have their names known 

        by authors. The journal has quarterly periodicity but, in special cases, 

        it may edit additional supplements. Fascicles are edited with 170 pages 

        as a mean containing not less than 10 scientific articles.

        and French. The article should contain <b>Introduction, Material and Methods, 

        Results and Discussion</b> (the last two chapters may come written together 

        or separated) <b>Acknowledgements</b> (if convenient) and <b>References</b>. 

        The titles of the above chapters should come written in small letters, 

        bold and centralized. The manuscript should be typewritten using Microsoft 

        Word Program, printed using Arial font size11, page A4, double-spaced, 

        and one copy in 3 1/2HD floppy disk. The text of the paper, original plus 

        two copies should come accompanied by respective annexes (Tables, figures, 

        photographs, drawings with respective labels, etc.). The text should come 

        normal, without restrictions in what diagraming or formatting concerns: 

        manual tabulation without backspaces, nor automatic numeration of neither 

        sections nor page brakes. The abstract (<b>Resume</b>) should be written 

        in the original language, not exceeding 250 words, explaining the objectives, 

        the techniques used, the main results and a conclusion in a single paragraph. 

        In the next line include not more than 5 <b>Key words</b> that should 

        be different than the ones contained in the title. When the paper is written 

        in English, it should contain, after the title and authors, the <b>Resume</b> 

        and in the following paragraph, the <b>Abstract</b>. If the article is

        in the beginning and, in the following paragraph the <b>Resumo</b>,<b> 

        Resume </b>or<b> R&eacute;sum&eacute;</b>, as the case may be. Within

        Specific names, when cited in the text for the first time, should come 

        accompanied by the name of the author and year of publication in small 

        letters. Latin expressions in italic. </p>

      <p>The <b>material examined</b> should be indicated in the text with information 

        on the locality of collection in terms of latitude, longitude and altitude 

        (whenever available); the map of the area studied may be convenient. The 

        institution where the studied material is deposited should be written 

        complete followed by the abbreviation (if available) and information of 

        the respective registrars. Bibliographic references (do not quote congress 

        abstracts, unpublished thesis and similar) should be quoted in the text 

        by the last name of the author, in small letters, followed by the year 

        of publication with brackets. In case of two authors, use the symbol &amp;. 

        For more than two authors, indicate the last name of the first author

        papers should obey an ascendant chronological order and the publications 

        should come separated by semicolon. In case of papers published in the 

        same year, use alphabetic order. When the same author publishes several 

        articles in the same year, they may be sequenced by the indication of 

        small letters after the year. The <b>References</b>, last chapter, should 

        be organized following an alphabetic and chronological order, according 

        to the Brazilian Association for Technical Rules ABNT. However, after 

        the name of the author(s), should come the year of publication, separated 

        from the first by a comma. Every time an author is repeated in the <b>References</b>, 

        it should be always cited. They should start keeping a displacement of 

        0.5 cm from the left Marge. Abbreviation of the names of journals should 

        follow the instructions of International Abstract of Biological Sciences, 

        indicating the volume, the first and last page of the article.<b> Figures</b> 

        (maps, graphs, photographs, drawings, etc.) should come numerated with 

        Arabic algorithms in sequence from left to right from up to down, and 

        should be dimensioned according to the page of the journal in portrait 

        (12.5 x 17.5 cm) or in landscape (17.5 x 12.5 cm). The illustrations should 

        come with the appropriate indication of their positioning, with arrows, 

        on the back face of the figure, showing the direction. Original forms 

        of the photographs, images and drawings are necessary so that good quality 

        for impression could be guaranteed. Scanned photographs should come with 

        300 dpi resolution and being reproducible in tiff format. Color illustrations 

        should be previously negotiated with the Editor and the cost rune to the 

        charge of the authors. <b>Tables </b>should come numerated with sequential 

        roman algorisms and should be prepared keeping the dimensions indicated 

        for the figures. <b>Figures</b> and <b>Tables</b> should be self-explanatory. 

        The legends should come in bold, printed in separated paper and should 

        contain what is strictly necessary for comprehension. The letters with 

        explanations of the details of figures and tables should come below the 

        legend in Arial font size 9. The quotations of the figures and tables 

        in the text should be written between brackets {Ex.:(Fig.1; Tab. ({I)}. 

        <b>Research note</b> should include <b>Abstract</b> and <b>Key words</b>, 

        <b>Acknowledgements</b> (when justified) and <b>References</b>. Not to
