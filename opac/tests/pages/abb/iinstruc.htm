    <td width="70%"><p>Experimental, theoretical and applied papers on all aspects of plant (including algae) and fungi<br>
      biology are welcome. The submitted manuscript or its essential content must not have been<br>
      published previously or be under consideration for publication elsewhere. Contributions<br>
      should be substantial, written in English and show general interest. Manuscripts that report<br>
      aspects of local interest are discouraged unless the implications of the findings are wide-<br>
      reaching. Manuscripts with agronomic subjects are expected to contain a substantial amount<br>
      of basic plant biology. Please see below some details for specific area.</p>
      <p>Algae, cyanobacteria and fungi</p>
      <p>Acta Botanica Brasilica considers studies on algae and cyanobacteria and all aspects of fungi<br>
        and lichens. The main topics covered are biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, ecology<br>
        (mainly interactions like mycorrhizas and endophytes), evolution, physiology and taxonomy.<br>
        Hypothesis-driven papers and studies based on an interdisciplinary research are encouraged.<br>
        The journal also welcome studies related to the development and test of new methodologies<br>
        and those studies on practical themes, whose results are applicable, for example, in<br>
        aquaculture or in environmental management and conservation. The manuscripts purely<br>
        descriptive, such as those focused on species lists, are discouraged.</p>
      <p>Mycological Diversity Description (MDD): the new modality for the publication of novel fungi<br>
        diversity</p>
      <p>Mycological Diversity Description (MDD) is a series of articles that describe new taxa (with or<br>
        without keys), and new geographical, substrate and/or host records for fungi and related<br>
        organisms. This series is intended to stimulate the publication of these discoveries using<br>
        phylogenies based on morphological and molecular data.</p>
      <p>Manuscripts submitted for MDD will be accumulated for up to 150 days, at which point they<br>
        will be grouped together in a larger article, which will include the description of several taxa by<br>
        numerous authors. The intention is to provide these taxa and the authors more visibility. The<br>
        author of the first manuscript to be submitted will be the first author of the article, with the<br>
        subsequent authors appearing in alphabetic order. The authorship of taxa will remain<br>
        according to the submitted manuscripts, since the grouping of several authors will be limited<br>
        to the entire article, not the individual descriptions of taxa.</p>
      <p>Ecology<br>
        <br>
        We welcome manuscripts spanning all ecological levels, from individuals to ecosystems.<br>
        Experimental and observational studies with ecological basis/background of fungi, algae, and<br>
        plant taxa from all biogeographic regions will be considered for publication. Interaction studies<br>
        should be focused on the plants point of view. We encourage the submission of hypothesis-<br>
        driven manuscripts that advance ecological knowledge, rather than submissions that describe<br>
        particular cases that are too geographically or taxonomically-focused. Studies dealing with<br>
        species conservation, management and restoration will also be considered for publication.<br>
        Please define clearly the ecological context of the study, questions/hypotheses, scope and<br>
        statistical methods reasoning, and advances obtained.</p>
      <p>Ethnobotany<br>
        <br>
        By recognizing ethnobotany as an area of interface between different fields of study, we<br>
        welcome the submission of manuscripts where the botanical component is clearly present.<br>
        Whenever appropriate, manuscripts should present information regarding prior informed<br>
        consent and the procedures related to the access to the traditional knowledge associated with</p>
      <p>biodiversity. Essentially descriptive and regional studies will not be accepted, such as lists of<br>
        useful species. We strongly recommend manuscripts with a clear theoretical framework and<br>
        with innovative combinations of qualitative and quantitative methodologies.</p>
      <p>Plant Physiology<br>
        <br>
        Acta Botanica Brasilica publishes manuscripts concerning plant physiological studies related to<br>
        aspects of germination, growth and development, plant nutrition, plant water relations, plant<br>
        molecular biology, plant metabolism and biochemistry, ecophysiology, plant-environment and<br>
        plant-biotic interactions. Merely descriptive studies or simply agricultural approaches without<br>
        a substantial physiological mechanism, will not be considered for publication.</p>
      <p>Plant Structure (morphology and anatomy)<br>
        <br>
        Acta Botanica Brasilica publishes original contributions on all aspects of plant structure<br>
        (morphology and anatomy), including cell biology and palynology. Innovative research on plant<br>
        structure, including studies related to evolution, ontogenesis (morphogenesis and<br>
        embryogenesis) and taxonomy are welcomed. Illustrations must be of high quality for<br>
        manuscripts to be considered. Purely descriptive manuscripts are discouraged.</p>
      <p>Taxonomy and Systematics<br>
        <br>
        Acta Botanica Brasilica publishes original papers related to systematics, taxonomy, floristics,<br>
        nomenclature and phytogeography, including theoretical papers and methodology, phylogeny,<br>
        short monographs, revisions, history of botanical explorations, analyses of characters,<br>
        phytogeographic studies, descriptions of new taxa and typification. Floras may be accepted<br>
        provided they be of general interest and combine the results in an integrative way with other<br>
    issues, such as taxonomy, conservation, ecology or biogeography.</p></td>

    <p>All manuscripts must follow these guidelines:  the text should be in Times New Roman font, size 12, double-spaced throughout  and with 25 mm margins; the paper size should be set to A4 (210 x 297 mm). All  pages should be numbered sequentially. Each line of the text should also be  numbered, with the top line of each page being line 1. For text files .doc, .docx  and .rtf are the only acceptable formats. Files in Adobe<sup>&reg;</sup> PDF format  (.pdf files) will not be accepted. When appropriate, the article file should  include a list of figure legends and table heads at the end. This article file  should not include any illustrations or tables, all of which should be  submitted in separate files.Do not include      field code either.</p>
    <p> The <strong>first page</strong> should state  the type of article (Original Article, Review, Viewpoint, Method,  Short  communication or MDD) and provide a concise and informative full title followed by the names of all  authors. Each name should be followed by the Orcid number an identifying  superscript number (<sup>1, 2, 3</sup> etc.) associated with the appropriate  institutional address to be entered further down the page. Only one  corresponding author should be indicated with an asterisk and should always be  the submitting author. The institutional address(es) of each author should be  listed next, each address being preceded by the superscript number where appropriate.  The address must be synthetic      and in English with institution, postal code, city, state and country. Do not translate      laboratory, department and university. Titles and  positions should not be mentioned. This information is followed by the e-mail  address of the corresponding author. </p>
    <p> The <strong>second page </strong>should  contain a structured <strong>Abstract</strong> not exceeding 200 words in a single  paragraph without references. The Abstract should outline the essential content  of the manuscript, especially the results and discussion, highlighting the  relevance of main findings.</p>
    <p> The Abstract should be followed by  between five and ten <strong>Key words</strong>. Note  that essential words in the title should be repeated in the key words. </p>
    <p>Original  articles should be divided into sections presented in the following order:</p>
    <p><b>Title page<br>
    Abstract<br>
Introduction<br>
Materials and methods<br>
Results<br>
Discussion<br>
Acknowledgements<br>
References<br>
Tables and Figure legends<br>
Supplementary Data</b> (if applicable)</p>
    <p><strong>Material and methods </strong>and<strong> Results</strong> should be clear and concise. The <strong>Discussion</strong> section should avoid extensive repetition of the results  and must finish with some  conclusions. This section can be combined with results (<strong>Results and discussion</strong>), however, we recommend authors consult the  Editoral Board for a previous evaluation. </p>
    <p><strong>Plant names </strong>must be  written out in full in the abstract and again in the main text for every  organism at first mention but the genus is only needed for the first species in  a list within the same genus (e.g. <em>Hymenaea stigonocarpa</em> e <em>H.  stilbocarpa</em>). The authority (e.g., L., Mill., Benth.) is required only in Material  and Methods section. Use The International Plant Names Index (www.ipni.org) for correct plants names.  Cultivars or varieties should be added to the scientific name (e.g. <em>Solanum  lycopersicum</em> 'Jumbo'). Authors must include in Material and Methods a  reference to voucher specimen(s) and voucher number(s) of the plants or other  material examined.</p>
    <p>      <strong>Abbreviations</strong> must be  avoidexceptfor  usual cases (see recent issues) and all terms must be written out in full when  used to start a sentence. Non-conventional abbreviations should be spelled out  at first mention.</p>
    <p>      <strong>Units of  Measurement.</strong> <em>Acta bot. bras.</em> adopts the <em>Syst&eacute;me International d'Unit&eacute;s </em>(SI). For volume, use the  cubic metre (e.g. 1 &times; 10<sup>&ndash;5</sup> m<sup>3</sup>) or the litre (e.g. 5 &mu;L, 5 mL, 5  L). For concentrations, use &mu;M, &mu;mol L<sup>&ndash;1</sup>  or mg L<sup>&ndash;1</sup>. For size and distance use meters (cm, mm, um, etc) and be  consistent in the manuscript.<strong></strong></p>
    <strong>Numbers</strong> up to nine should be written out unless they  are measurements. All numbers above ten should be in numerals unless they are  starting sentences.
    <p><strong>Citations in  the text</strong> should take the form of Silva (2012) or Ribeiro &amp;  Furr (1975) or (Mayer &amp; Wu 1987a;  b; Gonzalez 2014; Sirano 2014)  and be ordered chronologically. Papers by three or more authors, even on first  mention, should be abbreviated to the name of the first author followed by <em>et al</em>. (e.g. Simmons <em>et al</em>. 2014).  If two different authors have the same last name, and the article have the same  year of publication, give their initials (e.g. JS Santos 2003). Only refer to  papers as 'in press' if they have been accepted for publication in a named  journal, otherwise use the terms 'unpubl. res.', giving the initials and last  name of the person concerned (e.g., RA Santos unpubl. res.). </p>
    <p><strong>References </strong>should be  arranged alphabetically based on the surname of the author(s). Where the same author(s)  has two or more papers listed, these papers should be grouped in year order. Letters  'a', 'b', 'c', etc.,  should be added to the date of papers with the same &nbsp;citation in the text. Please provide DOI of &lsquo;in  press&rsquo; papers whenever possible.</p>
    <p>For papers  with <strong>six</strong> authors or fewer, please give the names of <em>all</em> the authors. For papers with <strong>seven</strong> authors or more, please  give the names of the <em>first three</em> authors only, followed by <em>et al</em>.</p>

The letters that  identify individual images should be inserted within white circles in the lower  right-hand corner. For separate the grouped images, authors should insert white  bars (1mm thickness).</p>
      <p> Individual images (not grouped as a plate) should be identified with  sequential Arabic numerals, in the order of their citation in the text (Fig. 1,  Fig. 2, Fig. 3, etc.), presented in the same manner as the letters identifying  individual images (described above).</p>
      <p> The number that identifies a grouped figure (e.g., Fig. 2) should not be  inserted into the plate but should rather be referenced only in the figure caption  and the text (e.g., Fig. 2A-C).</p>
      <p> Scale bars, when required, should be positioned in the lower right-hand  corner of the figure. The scale bar units should be given either at the end of  the figure caption or, when a figure contains multiple scale bars with  different units, above each bar. <br>
        Details within a figure can be indicated with arrows, letters or symbols,  as appropriate. </p>
      <p> Tables should be preceded by titles, indicated with sequential Arabic  numerals (Table 1, 2, 3, etc.; do not abbreviate). Tables should be created  using the Table function of Microsoft Word&trade;. Columns and rows should be  visible, although no dark lines should be used to separate them. Horizontal  rules should be used only at the top (below the title) and bottom (below the  final row) of the table. Do not use fills, shading or colors in the tables.</p>
      <p> When appropriate, excess (but important) data can be submitted as  Supplementary Files, which will be published online and will be made available  as links. This might include additional figures, tables, or other materials  that are necessary to fully document the research contained in the paper or to  facilitate the readers' ability to understand the work.</p>
      <p> Supplementary Materials are linked from the main article  webpage. They can be cited using the same DOI as the paper.</p>
      <p> Supplementary Materials should be presented in appropriate .doc file for      text and tables and .tiff file at 300dpi for figures and graphics.  The full title of the paper and author names  should be included in the header. All supplementary figures and tables should  be referred in the manuscript body as &ldquo;Table S1&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;Figure S1&rdquo;.</p>
    <em>Acta bot. bras.</em> intends to maintain  archives of Supplementary Materials but does not guarantee their permanent  availability. <em>Acta bot. bras.</em> reserves the right to  remove Supplementary Materials from a published article in the future.</td>
