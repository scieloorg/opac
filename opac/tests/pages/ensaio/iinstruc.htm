    <p><strong>Ensaio</strong> reserves  the right, before submitting the article for peer review, to check for  plagiarism using PlagScan and CopySpider.<br>
        <strong>Ensaio</strong> reserves  the right not to accept for evaluation, manuscripts with a high level of  self-plagiarism.<br>
      Authors must ensure the originality  of the manuscript, and in case of use of parts of other articles, must make the  necessary quotes.<br>

    <strong>6. Evaluation of Article    </strong>
    <p>Submitted  articles are evaluated in a double-blind system, in which two reviewers, Board  members or <em>ad hoc</em> staff, from  different institutions, analyze the relevance of the contribution for the existing  knowledge in the area.<br>
      If  there is disparity in opinions the journal will choose a third reviewer, expert  on the subject, to untie the evaluation of the article.<br>
      Items  will be sent to reviewers, after compliance with the requirements described  above, through the Journals website of Cesgranrio Foundation/Ensaio, without  identifying the author. Similarly, it will not be revealed reviewer&rsquo;s names to  the authors.</p>
    <p>There is no fee for submission and review articles.</p>

    <p>After  evaluation, the author receives the reviews, which may request revisions or  adjustments, always seeking to improve the text.<br>
      The  article should be redrafted and resubmitted to the journal (through the website)  in a maximum of 30 days from the date of the revisions request.<br>
      The text  should include the changes highlighted in yellow.<br>
      The editor  shall reserve the right to refuse an article for which revisions were asked and  were not made, or delivered out of time. With regard to publication, the editor  has the last word.<br>
      After revisions,  and the article not being approved for publication, the journal will notify the  author of the editorial process through the website, and archive the article,  with no obligation to return the original versions.<br>
  <strong>Note</strong>: The editorial process can be followed through  the Journals website of Cesgranrio Foundation.<br>
      After  logging in and clicking on the active article, visit the tab <em>avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o</em>.</p>
    <strong>6.2 If approved    </strong>
    <p>Article status will change from <em>&quot;Em avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o&quot;</em> to <em>&quot;Em edi&ccedil;&atilde;o&quot;</em>. The next steps  will be publishing, XML markup, and paper and online publication on a volume to  be set by the publisher.<br>
