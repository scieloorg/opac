      <p>Journal  Profile</p>

      <p>With a rather unique  editorial profile among Brazilian academic publications, <em>Estudos Avan&ccedil;ados</em> publishes articles on subjects of humanistic, scientific  and technological culture.</p>
      <p>Readership</p>
      <p>Readers include  teachers and students from public and private high schools, undergraduate and  graduate students from public and private institutions of higher learning,  university professors of public and private institutions, researchers,  scientists, professionals, community and social movement leaders, public administrators,  politicians, businesspeople and journalists, among others.</p>
      <p>Consideration  of manuscripts</p>
      <p>Original articles  submitted for consideration will be analyzed firstly by the Editorial Desk for  compliance to editorial standards, internal coherence, relevance to the journal's  editorial line, and contribution to innovation in its field of knowledge.  Important notice: in this stage, the original manuscript must not exceed 40,000  characters with spaces.</p>
      <p> If approved in the  preliminary stage, the manuscript is forwarded for a merit analysis of its  contents. This is the peer review stage, where both the consultants and the authors  remain anonymous. The manuscript is analyzed by the  journal's assessment tool. Expert opinions submitted by the consultants  are reviewed by the Editorial Desk for compliance with the rules of  publication, content and relevance. After this process, the manuscript is sent back  to its authors with a statement of acceptance, reformulation or rejection.</p>
      <p>There is no fee for submission and review articles.</p>
      <p>The moral and intellectual rights of articles belong to the authors, not being property of the journal.</p>
      <p>Submission  of manuscripts</p>
      <p>Original articles may  be submitted for consideration by e-mail, at <a href="mailto:estudosavancados@usp.br">estudosavancados@usp.br</a>, or online  via Scielo (Scientific Electronic Library Online).</p>
