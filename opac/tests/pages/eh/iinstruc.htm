      <p>The journal <b>Estudos Hist&oacute;ricos</b> has an interdisciplinary profile, 

        its goal being the publication of unpublished works by researchers in 

        the fields of History, Social Sciences, Literature, etc., which have a 

        historical perspective. </p>

      <p><b>Estudos Hist&oacute;ricos</b> will only accept unpublished works in the form 

        of articles, reviews and bibliographic analyses. All articles presented 

        to the publishers will be submitted to two evaluators so that they can 

        give an assessment. The process of evaluation by pairs is the system of 

        blind review, in a procedure that keeps secret the identity of the authors 

        and of the revisers. In case a conflict of interests on the part of the 

        revisers is detected, the Editorial Committee will send the manuscript 

        to another reviser ad hoc. In case there are disagreements in the assessments, 

        the editors will send the text to a third party for evaluation. </p>

      <p><b>The assessments of the revisers will recommend, alternatively:</b> 

      </p>

      <p>a) complete acceptance; <br>

        b) acceptance with reformulations; <br>

        c) refusal of the submitted text. </p>

      <p>In any of these cases, the author will be informed. The final decision 

        on whether or not the manuscript will be published is always made by the 

        editors, who also reserve themselves the right to decide on the necessity 

        of introducing alterations in the composition of the originals. The alterations 

        always aim at keeping the homogeneity and quality of journal, albeit respecting 

        the style and the opinion of the authors. Therefore, the articles will 

        express solely and exclusively the opinions and conclusions of its authors. 

      </p>

      <p>The texts written in foreign languages, when accepted by the Editorial 

        Board, will be translated to Portuguese with permission of the author.
