    <p align="justify"><strong>Types of studies accepted  by the journal Estudos de Psicologia (Campinas)</strong><br>Articles  are pre-analyzed by the Editorial Board before they are submitted to <em>ad hoc</em> referee assessment. The following  study categories are accepted for publication:<br>
      <br>
  <strong>-  Research report</strong>: original articles based on empiric data. These  articles consist of the following sections: introduction, method, results, and  discussion.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>-  Theoretical article</strong>: literature review of Psychology-related themes,  questioning existing models and the creation of hypotheses for future studies.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>-  Systematic literature review article</strong>: presents a summary of the results of  original, quantitative, or qualitative studies answering a specific question  important for the area of Psychology. It describes the search method used for  finding original studies, the criteria for selecting the reviewed studies, and  the procedures used for summarizing the results of the reviewed studies.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>- Case report</strong>: reports of studies  conducted on individuals, groups, or organizations indicating a problem and a  way to solve it based on the literature.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>- Theme section (by  invitation only)</strong>:<strong> </strong>section that aims to publish coordinated articles  written by different authors, discussing a theme of current interest. Only  authors who have been invited by the editors may submit articles for this  section.<br>

      Manuscripts that fit into  one of the categories and areas above will be pre-analyzed by the Editorial  Board.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>Authorship</strong> <br>
      Authorship  credit must be based on substantial contributions, such as (I) conception and  design; (II) data analysis and interpretation, and discussion of the results;  and (III) review and approval of the final version of the article.<br>
      The  inclusion of authors whose contribution does not meet one of the criteria above  is not justified. <br>
      <br>
      Estudos  de Psicologia (Campinas) does not publish more than one article from the same  author (including both the position of main author and co-author) during the  same year (volume). This rule aims to increase the number of themes and  collaborations made by national and foreign authors.</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>Plagiarism</strong><br>
      The Journal will check  submitted articles, through the CrossCheck plagiarism detection tool, after the  peer review process.</p>

      <br>
Original manuscripts will  be accepted for assessment as long as they have not been submitted to any other  journal and/or published in events to preserve the original character of the  article, and that they are accompanied by: Letter of presentation of article  for submission, Check list for submission completed, in addition to the other  documents listed in the item &quot;Documentation&quot;. <strong>All authors of the paper must sign all documents</strong>.<br>
<br>
The editorial process will  only begin if the manuscripts follow the instructions to the authors. If not,  they will be returned to the authors for adjustment to the norms and/or  inclusion of letters or other documents before they are submitted to  pre-analysis by the Editorial Board and later, to merit assessment by <em>ad hoc</em> referees.<br>
<br>
The outcomes of the  pre-analysis phase are:
<br>
(1) The manuscript is sent  to <em>ad hoc </em>referees.<br>
(2) The manuscript is  returned to the authors with a request for changes.<br>
(3) The manuscript is  refused because of its: (I) content regarding the theme line of the journal;  (II) originality, importance of the theme, and quality of the scientific method  used.<br>
(4) The manuscript will be  sent to <em>ad hoc</em> referee assessment if it meets the abovementioned  criteria.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Assessment of the manuscripts</strong> <br>
        The journal uses blind  review, that is, the authors and referees remain anonymous. The authors must  make sure that there are no elements anywhere in the text capable of disclosing  their identity.<br>
        <br>
        The articles without the  authors’ names will be sent to at least two <em>ad hoc</em> referees.<br>
        <br>
        When changes are requested,  the studies will be returned to the authors for the requested corrections based  on the referees’ suggestions.<br>
        <br>
        The corrections must be  returned within 30 days (small reformulation) and 60 days (extensive  reformulation), respecting the time zone of the system (Greenwich Mean Time -  London).<br>
        <br>
        The possible outcomes of  the peer review process are: (a) approval; (b) request manuscript reassessment  after small reformulation; (c) recommend manuscript reassessment after  extensive reformulation; (d) refusal. The author will always be informed of the  outcome.<br>
        <br>
        Two favorable referee  opinions are required for publication. If the referees disagree, the article  will be submitted to a third referee for new assessment.<br>
        <br>
        The manuscript assessment  process will end on the second round. The editors always have the last word  regarding the publication of the article. The Editorial Board of the journal  may make small changes in the text according to the journal’s internal review  criteria and norms.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Conflicts of interest<br>

    <p align="justify">All tables, figures,  graphs, drawings, schemes, flowcharts, photographs, maps, organograms,  diagrams, blueprints, charts, pictures, etc. are considered illustrations, and  they should be used for illustrating the study data. Figures must not contain  the same data as tables.<br>
      <br>
A manuscript may have no  more than five (5) illustrations, regardless of type.<br>
<br>
The illustrations must be  inserted after the references and also submitted separately in their original  file formats at the ScholarOne platform, in Step 6.<strong></strong><br>
<br>
The illustrations <strong>must  be editable</strong>. The following <em>graphic</em> design <em>software  and word processor </em>are accepted: Excel, GraphPrism, SPSS 22, Corel Draw Suite X7, and Word.  Therefore, images can be submitted only in the following file extensions: cdr, .pzf, .spv, .jpg, .jpeg,  .xls, .xlsx, .doc, .docx, .vsdx, .vst. If a different software is used, use the  standard font Frutiger size 7, which is the font used by the Journal during  editing.<br>
<strong> </strong> <br>
Images must have a minimum  resolution of 600 dpi. Graphs and drawings must be generated in graphic design  programs, such as Microsoft Excel, CorelDraw, Adobe Illustrator, etc., and  accompanied by their quantitative parameters in a table. Include the names of  all variables.<br>
<br>
Color illustrations are  accepted at no extra cost to the authors.<br>
Graphs must not have grid  lines, and elements (bars, circles) must be two-dimensional (3D not accepted).<br>
<br>
The author is responsible  for the quality of the illustrations. Make sure it is possible to reduce the  size of the illustrations to the widths of one or two columns (7 cm and 15 cm  respectively) without loss of resolution. <strong>The  landscape format is not accepted</strong>.<br>
<br>
Each illustration must have  a short title. Illustrations must be numbered consecutively and independently  with Arabic numerals in the order in which they are mentioned in the text. In  graphs include the title of the axes.<br>
<br>
Graphs must contain the  title of all axes ans all columns of Tables and Charts must have headers.<br>
<br>
The words <strong>Figure</strong>, <strong>Table</strong>,  and <strong>Attachment</strong> in the text must be capitalized and accompanied by the  respective number. Indicate in the text where the illustrations should be  inserted. Keep titles concise.<br>
<br>
Always include explanatory  notes where necessary. If abbreviations and/or symbols (such as bold, asterisk,  etc.) are used, indicate their meaning in the footnote of the illustration.<br>
<br>
Manuscripts written in  languages other than Portuguese should include accurate translation of the  illustrations (tables, charts, and figures) and use the proper decimal  separator. For example, in manuscripts written in English, the dot or period is  used as the decimal point within numbers: 1,254.76 grams.<br>
<br>
If illustrations published in other references are  used, attach the document containing the authorization for their use and cite  the source. In the case of photographs, it is necessary to send a statement  with the authorization to use the image, even if there is an attempt to hide  the identity of the photograph.<br>
<br>
The authors must ensure  that nothing in the manuscript infringes any copyrights or intellectual  property of another, otherwise they may respond legally in accordance with the  terms of Law n° 9.610/98, which consolidates copyright legislation. </p>
    
    <p align="justify"><strong>Citations</strong><br>
      Citations in foreign  languages translated into Portuguese by the authors should be accompanied by a  footnote citation in the original language. The source should be followed by  the phrase &ldquo;our translation,&rdquo; as follows: (Pfeiffer, 2015, p. 24; our  translation).<br>
      Secondary references (a  citation of the citation of the original author) will not be accepted.<br>
      <br>
      Citations of articles with  multiple authors should be done as follows:<br>
  <strong>Article with two  authors</strong>:  cite both authors every time the article is mentioned.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Articles with three  to five authors</strong>:  cite all authors the first time the article is mentioned in the text. After  that, cite only the first author followed by <em>et al.</em> and the date.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Articles with six or  more authors</strong>:  cite only the first author followed by <em>et al.</em> and the year.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Old and reedited  sources</strong>:  Citations of old sources with newer editions must include two dates, the date  of the first edition and the date of the version read by the author. For example:  Freud (1912/1969, p.154). If there are two or more citations or references of  the same publication, distinguish them with lower case letters. For example,  Freud (1939/1969a) and so successively.<br>
      Literal citations with a  maximum of forty (40) words should remain in the current paragraph in quotes,  indicating the last name of the author, date, and page.<br>
      Citations with more than 40  words should be made in a new paragraph, with single-line spacing, font size  11, and a left margin of 4cm.</p>
    
    <p align="justify"><strong>References</strong><br>
<br>
      References and citations  should follow the norms provided by APA (6th edition, 2010).<br>
      <br>
      Most references (50%) must  be no older than five (5) years and must have been published in indexed  journals (<strong>mandatory</strong>). <br>
      The journal does not accept  citations/references from undergraduate monographs, unpublished texts (classes,  etc.), and abstracts from studies presented in congresses, symposiums,  workshops, and meetings, among others.<br>
      <br>
      Citations of a journal  article in press, whether it was written by one of the authors or by different  sources, <strong>must be</strong> accompanied by a  copy of the letter of acceptance (article accepted but not yet published) from  the journal it is going to be published. If this requirement is not fulfilled,  the citation/reference will be excluded.<br>
      If unpublished data  obtained by other researchers are cited in the manuscript, it is necessary to  include a letter authorizing the use of such data by the original authors.<br>
      <br>
      Studies with a single  author must be listed before studies with multiple authors when the last name  is the same.<br>
      Studies with the same first  author but different coauthors should be listed in alphabetical order of the  coauthors.<br>
      <br>
      Studies from the same  authors must be listed by date, citing the oldest study first.<br>
      <br>
      Studies from the same  authors and same date must be distinguished by lower case letters (a and b).  Avoid in press articles.<br>
      All addresses with internet  links (URL) in the references must be active and lead directly to the cited  document. Inform the date the document was accessed (see examples of electronic  material).<br>
      When the cited document has  a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) number, inform the number and exclude the  access date (see examples of electronic material). The hyperlink  https://doi.org/... must be used.<br>
      <br>
      References format should  facilitate manuscript revision and editing.    Therefore, they should be written using double spacing and 12-point font  size. All lines after the first line of each entry in your reference list  should be indented 0.5 cm from the left margin. Try to include references  published in the journal Estudos de Psicologia (Campinas) to help increase its  impact factor.<br>
      <br>
      The authors are responsible  for the accuracy and adequacy of the references that have been consulted and  mentioned in the manuscript and for their content.<br>
      <br>
      All  authors cited in the text should be followed by the publication date and listed  in the references. </p>
