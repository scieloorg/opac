      <p>3.2 Category<br>
        The manuscripts can be Scientific article, Technical article, and  Review article. <br>
        3.2.1 Scientific  Article<br>
        Scientific  articles refer to reports of original research, with a well-defined hypothesis  and innovation issues. The text should  include the items, always highlighted in capital letters and bold unnumbered  paragraph and, leaving two spaces (ENTER twice) after the previous item and a  space (ENTER once) to begin the text, in the following order: Title, name of  the authors, abstract, keywords, Material and methods, Results, Conclusion,  Acknowledgments and References.</p>
      <p> Title:  Centralized, should be clear and concise, allowing prompt identification of the  content of the study, trying to avoid words like: analysis, study and  evaluation.</p>
      <p> Abstract: The  text should start on the same line of the item, be clear, succinct and  mandatorily explain the intended objectives, trying to justify its importance  (not including references), the main procedures adopted, the most significant  results and conclusions, containing a maximum of 14 lines. Below should appear  the keywords (six at most, trying not repeating the title) written in  lowercase.</p>
      <p> Introduction: Should  be concise, in at most 50 lines, using recent literature (preferably peer  reviewed articles published over last 5 years) and appropriate to formulate the  problems addressed and the justification of the importance of the subject,  making very clear the objective of the study.</p>
      <p> Material and  methods: Depending on the nature of the study, a characterization of the experimental  area must be inserted, making clear the conditions under which the research was  conducted. When the public domain methods are used only the reference will be sufficient,  otherwise is required description of the procedures used, adjustments promoted,  etc. Measurement units and symbols should follow the International System.</p>
      <p> Results and  discussion: The results should be compared with those of the literature  presented in the Introduction and with others pertinent to the field of work,  and discussed in the light of established knowledge, agreeing or disagreeing  with scientific or technical explanations, but highlighting the importance and originality  of such data. The wording of this item should be elaborated not only by  reporting that the results obtained agree with or disagree with the results  obtained by other researchers, but also, in a clear and concise way, seek to  explain why the results were those and why they agree or disagree with the  results &nbsp;presented in the literature</p>
      <p> Conclusions: These  should be based exclusively on the results of the study. Avoid repetition of  results in subsequent listing, confronting what was obtained with the goals  initially set. The conclusions should be written to facilitate interpretation  of the article, without consulting other items of it.</p>
      <p> Acknowledgments:  Enter it, if any, after conclusions, succinctly.</p>
      <p> References:  Should be mentioned only the essential related to the manuscript, including  only those mentioned in the text and tables, graphs or illustrations, appearing  in alphabetical order and in lowercase letters. Avoid quoting abstracts,  unpublished articles and personal communication. At least 50% of the references  should be in the last 5 years and 90% of periodic articles.</p>
      <p> Exceptional cases should be justified and will be reviewed by the Editorial  Committee. The references in the text must also appear in capital letters,  followed by the date:</p>
      <p> Souza &amp;  Silva (2005), or (Souza &amp; Silva, 2005); existing other references of the  same author in the same year (other publications), it will be identified with  lowercase letters (a, b, c) after the year of publication: Souza &amp; Silva  (2005 a). For three or more authors, in the text will be quoted only the first  author followed by et al., but in the final bibliography list other names  should also appear. In quotation from quotation (to be avoided), identifies the  directly consulted article, the author and / or the article mentioned in it as  indicated: Silva (2000) cited by Pessoa (2006).

      <p>3.2.2. Technical  Article<br>
  Should include advances in theories,  methodologies and techniques, without a hypothesis presentation. When dealing  with a case study, the conclusions should present proposals. It should be  written in technical language, easy to understand, on matters of interest to  the Agricultural Engineering by author(s) showing experience on the subject  dealt, allowing guidance to the different users of Agricultural Engineering. It  only justifies submitting articles that bring contribution on the subject and  not just personal cases or restricted interest. With freer style than in  scientific articles, technical articles should, in most cases, include the  following items: Title, Author(s), Abstract, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction,  description of the subject, Conclusions and References. The text of the  technical articles should followthe same guidelines for scientific articles,  with the following particular remarks:<br>
        Header:  TECHNICAL ARTICLE should appear in the header of the first page, in capital  letters, underlined, in bold, centered and spaced 1.1 cm from the top edge.<br>
        Introduction:  should contain brief background, explaining the importance, the current status  of the subject, relying on literature review, and make clear the aim of the  article.<br>
        Subject description:  with different titles that can be divided into sub-items, the matter should be  discussed, pointing up the theoretical basis, bringing experiences and  recommendations, discussing and criticizing situations, based on the fullest  bibliography and technical standards on the subject.</p>
      <p> Conclusions:  When appropriate, should be written in a clear and concise manner, consistent  with the goal established. Should not be a simple resubmission of other  paragraphs of the article.</p>
      <p>3.2.3. Review  Article: It is the presentation, exclusively by a request of the Editorial  Committee, of a study by gathering, analyzing and discussing an issue of  importance to the Agricultural Engineering, and based on extensive literature  search, allowing compilation of existing knowledge. Although with more  stylistic freedom than in scientific articles, review articles should contain  the following items: Title, Author(s), Abstract, Keywords, Introduction,  Review, Conclusions and References. The writing of these items should follow  the same guidelines described for scientific articles, with the following  particular remarks:<br>
        Header: REVIEW  ARTICLE should appear on the front page headline in capital letters,  underlined, in bold, centered and spaced 1.1 cm from the top edge.<br>
        Introduction:  should contain brief background, placing the importance, the current status of  the subject and purpose of the review.</p>
      <p> Review: follow  the standards of the journal citation. If necessary, it can be divided by  subjects in sub items. The essay should be critical and not just mere exposure  of the issues; it must present a logical sequence in order of subjects and / or  chronological. Whenever possible, should contain an analysis of comparative  studies on the subject dealt.<br>
        Conclusions:  should be presented clearly and concisely, consistent with the goals  established. It should not be a simple restatement of paragraphs of the review.</p>
