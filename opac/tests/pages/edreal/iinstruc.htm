      <p>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o  &amp; Realidade accepts for publication articles related to education,  resulting from theoretical studies, research, reflections on concrete practices  or polemical and up to date debates in the area. The text, in Portuguese,  Spanish or English, must be unpublished. Research reports should be turned into  texts for publication in a scientific journal, following the standards of  Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Realidade.</p>
      <p> The  selection of articles for publication takes into consideration whether the text  is a contribution to education within the limits of the editorial guidelines of  the journal, the originality of the theme or the treatment of the subject, the  consistency and accuracy of the theoretical approach as well as the general  quality of the text. The review process of articles submitted to Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp;  Realidade follows this process:</p>
      <p>a) Analysis on the form: at this stage, articles  are examined by at least two of the editors and are assessed for their  compliance with the general criteria and the editorial line of Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp;  Realidade. Papers are rejected if they: 1) are experience reports; 2) are  configured solely as literature review; 3) are a part of a dissertation or  thesis without proper adaptation; 4) are a project or research report; 5) do  not present a sufficiently thorough analysis of the issue which is presented in  the paper; 6) do not have theoretical or methodological consistency; 7) do not  have the field of education as a central axis of the discussion; 8) have  grammatical errors or problems in the structure of the text; 9) are merely  descriptive and do not present an analysis of the issues being presented; 10)  do not have the form of a scientific article; 11) do not meet standards of  Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Realidade for article submissions (formatting, citations,  references...); 12) do not show results, formulations or conclusions that  represents improvements to the present knowledge in the area of the paper; 13)  do not present empirical evidence or sufficiently developed arguments that  support the conclusions. The papers that do not fall into any of the above  categories will be considered for the next phase.</p>
      <p> b) Peer  Review &ndash; merit-based: in this second phase, the Editors of Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp;  Realidade send the article, without identifying the author, to at least two  expert referees (editorial board members or guests ad hoc). For the selection  of referees and thematic areas the journal takes into account the CNPq areas  and the set of accessible information on the platform LATTES. The referees can  fully accept the article, request reformulations or reject the article. These  decisions are always documented with a written review. When the two referees  refuse the text, it is returned to the author. When the two referees accept the  text, it goes to the next phase. Finally, when one or two referees request  reformulations, the text is returned to the author, requesting that he/she  consider the opinions and reformulate the article within thirty days. When the  author returns the reformulated text, according to the suggestions of the  referees, it is reassessed and proceeds to the final stage.</p>
      <p>c) Proofreading and adaptation of the paper to  the norms of Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Realidade: once accepted for publication, the paper  is subjected to language review and standardization. The article is sent to the  author with suggestions for corrections and adjustments, before it is sent by  the editors for publication.</p>
      <p>Articles accepted for publication become property of the journal.</p>
    <p>The Journal adopts iThenticate system for plagiarism identification.</p></td>
