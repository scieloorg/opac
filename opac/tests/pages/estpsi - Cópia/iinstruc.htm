    <p>The  mission of the journal <strong>Estudos de  Psicologia</strong> (e-ISSN 1982-0275) is to promote and disseminate scientific and  technical knowledge in the area of psychology and to discuss the meaning of  practices in the professional and research fields by publishing original  articles that represent important contributions to the area of psychology.</p>
    <p>The  journal also publishes theoretical studies, reviews, and communications  important to psychology as science and profession, encouraging contributions of  the national and foreign scientific communities.</p>
    <p>Articles  in the following areas are accepted: Psychological Assessment, Developmental  Psychology, Educational Psychology, Health Psychology, Social and  Organizational Psychology, and Theory and Methods in Psychology.</p>
    <p>All  articles should be submitted in electronic format at &lt;<a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/estpsi-scielo">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/estpsi-scielo</a>&gt;.</p>
    <p><strong>Types of studies accepted by the journal Estudos  de Psicologia</strong></p>
<p>Articles  are pre-analyzed by the Editorial Board before they are submitted to ad hoc  referee assessment. The following study categories are accepted for  publication:</p>
<p><strong>-  Research report</strong>: original  articles based on empiric data. These articles consist of the following  sections: introduction, method, results, and discussion.</p>
<p><strong>-  Theoretical article</strong>:  literature review of psychology-related themes, questioning existing models and  the creation of hypotheses for future studies.</p>
<p><strong>-  Systematic literature review article</strong>: presents a summary of the results of original,  quantitative, or qualitative studies answering a specific question important  for the area of psychology. It describes the search method used for finding  original studies, the criteria for selecting the reviewed studies, and the  procedures used for summarizing the results of the reviewed studies.</p>
<p><strong>-  Case report</strong>: reports of  studies conducted on individuals, groups, or organizations indicating a problem  and a way to solve it based on the literature.</p>
<p><strong>- Theme section (by invitation only): </strong>section that aims to publish coordinated  articles written by different authors, discussing a theme of current interest.  Only authors who have been invited by the editors may submit articles for this  section.</p>
<p>Manuscripts  that fit into one of the categories and areas above will be pre-analyzed by the  Editorial Board.</p>
<p><strong>Authorship</strong></p>
<p>Authorship  credit must be based on substantial contributions, such as (I) conception and  design; (II) data analysis and interpretation, and discussion of the results;  and (III) review and approval of the final version of the article.</p>
<p>The  inclusion of authors whose contribution does not meet one of the criteria above  is not justified. Therefore, please send a declaration stating the contribution  made by each author and include this information on the cover page of the  manuscript.</p>
<p>Estudos  de Psicologia (Campinas) does not publish more than two articles from the same  author (including both the position of main author and co-author) during the  same year (volume). This rule aims to increase the number of themes and  collaborations made by national and foreign authors.</p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p>The  journal uses a tool for detecting plagiarism on all articles before submitting  them to peer review.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment by the editorial board</strong></p>
<p>Original  articles will be accepted for assessment as long as they have not been  submitted to any other journal and/or been published in events so as to  preserve their original character. Articles must be accompanied by a submission  letter signed by all authors requesting publication in the journal.</p>
<p>The  editorial process will only begin if the manuscripts follow the instructions to  the authors. If not, they will be returned to the authors for adjustment to the  norms and/or inclusion of letters or other documents before they are submitted  to pre-analysis by the Editorial Board and later, to merit assessment by <em>ad hoc</em> referees.</p>
<p>The  outcomes of the pre-analysis phase are:</p>
<p>(1) the manuscript is sent to <em>ad hoc </em>referees.<br>
(2) the manuscript is returned to the  authors with a request for changes.<br>
(3) the manuscript is refused because of  its: (I) content regarding the theme line of the journal; (II) originality,  importance of the theme, and quality of the scientific method used.<br>
(4) the manuscript will be sent to <em>ad hoc</em> referee assessment if it meets  the abovementioned criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of the manuscripts</strong></p>
<p>The journal uses blind review, that is, the authors and referees remain anonymous. The authors must make sure that  there are no elements anywhere in the text capable of disclosing their identity.</p>
<p>The articles without the authors&rsquo; names  will be sent to at least two <em>ad hoc</em> referees.</p>
<p>When changes are requested, the studies  will be returned to the authors for the requested corrections based on the  referees&rsquo; suggestions.</p>
<p>The corrections must be returned within  30 days (small reformulation) and 60 days (extensive reformulation), respecting  the time zone of the system (Greenwich Mean Time - London).</p>
<p>The possible outcomes of the peer review  process are: a) approval; b) request manuscript reassessment after small  reformulation; c) recommend manuscript reassessment after extensive  reformulation; d) refusal. The author will always be informed of the outcome.</p>
<p>Two favorable referee opinions are  required for publication. If the referees disagree, the article will be  submitted to a third referee for new assessment.</p>
<p>The manuscript assessment process will end on  the second round. The editors always have the last word regarding the  publication of the article. The Editorial Board of the journal may make small  changes in the text according to the journal&rsquo;s internal review criteria and norms.</p>
<p><strong>Conflicts  of interest</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> The authors must declare explicitly and  individually any potential, direct and/or indirect, financial or nonfinancial  conflict of interest.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ad hoc </em>referees:</strong> If any of the referees report a conflict of  interest, the Editorial Board will send the manuscript to another <em>ad hoc</em> referee.</p>
<p><strong>Reformulated  article</strong></p>
<p>The reformulated article must be  submitted at: &lt;<a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/estpsi-scielo">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/estpsi-scielo</a>&gt;. The author(s) must submit only the  reformulated version. Use blue font to make changes. The authors must also  attach a letter to the editor reiterating their interest in publishing with the  journal and informing the changes made to the manuscript.</p>
<p>If the author(s) disagree with the  recommendations made by the referees, the author(s) must present arguments that  justify their position. If the authors do not resubmit the reformulated article  and response letter within the deadline, the editorial process will be  terminated at any phase of the submission.</p>
<p><strong>Publication  in English</strong></p>
<p>If the article is approved, the journal may suggest  that articles in Portuguese be translated into English. In these cases, for the  article to be published, the authors must have the approved version translated  in full. The translation is paid by the authors.</p>
<p>To ensure the quality and uniformity of the texts translated into  English, the translation must be made by one of the translators appointed and  accredited by the journal.
<p><strong>Proofs</strong>
<p>PDF  proofs will be sent to the authors for correction of the final art of the  article. The proofs must be returned to the Publishing Center before the  deadline (48 hours). Other changes to the original manuscript will not be  accepted during this phase.
<p>We  will only accept spelling corrections and/or substitution of one or another  word or numerical data in the tables and graphs. We will not accept the  inclusion and/or exclusion of sentences, paragraphs, images, and references. If  something needs correction, do it as follows:
<ul>
<li>In the PDF file of the article using the available resources,  or</li>
<li>Make a note in capital letters on the margin of the  paper and send only the scanned pages with the corrections, or </li>
<li>Make a list in a Microsoft Word document  informing: page, column (right or left), paragraph, beginning of the sentence,  and its respective line.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  authors must sign the terms of agreement with the final art (text and  illustrations). The templates will be sent along with the proofs.</p>

<p>The sections in <strong>qualitative studies</strong> may vary according to their content.</p>
<p><strong>d)  Illustrations</strong></p>
<p>All tables, figures, graphs, drawings,  schemes, flowcharts, photographs, maps, organograms, diagrams, blueprints,  charts, pictures, etc. are considered illustrations, and they should be used  for illustrating the study data. Figures must not contain the same data as  tables.</p>
<p>A manuscript may have no more than five  (5) illustrations, regardless of type.</p>
<p>The illustrations must be inserted after  the References in the text editor file in addition to being submitted  separately, in their original file format, through the platform ScholarOne.</p>

<p><strong>e)  Citations</strong></p>
<p>Citations in foreign languages translated  into Portuguese by the authors should be accompanied by a footnote citation in  the original language. The source should be followed by the phrase &ldquo;our  translation,&rdquo; as follows: (Pfeiffer, 2015, p. 24; our translation). </p>
<p>Secondary references (a citation of the  citation of the original author) will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Citations of articles with multiple  authors should be done as follows:</p>
<p>Article with two authors: cite both  authors every time the article is mentioned.</p>
<p>Articles with three to five authors: cite  all authors the first time the article is mentioned in the text. After that,  cite only the first author followed by <em>et  al.</em> and the date.Articles with six or more authors: cite  only the first author followed by <em>et al.</em> and the year.</p>
<p>Old and reedited sources: Citations of  old sources with newer editions must include two dates, the date of the first  edition and the date of the version read by the author. For example: Freud  (1912/1969, p.154). If there are two or more citations or references of the same  publication, distinguish them with lower case letters. For example, Freud  (1939/1969a) and so successively.</p>
<p>Literal citations with a maximum of  forty (40) words should remain in the current paragraph in quotes, indicating  the last name of the author, date, and page.</p>

<p>The journal  does not accept citations/references from undergraduate monographs, unpublished  texts (classes, etc.), and abstracts from studies presented in congresses,  symposiums, workshops, and meetings, among others.</p>
<p>If an  unpublished study from the author and/or other sources is cited, that is, an  article in press, the full reference must have been published by the end of the  manuscript assessment process. If not, the citation/reference will be excluded.</p>
<p>Studies with  a single author must be listed before studies with multiple authors when the  last name is the same.</p>
<p>Studies with  the same first author but different coauthors should be listed in alphabetical  order of the coauthors.</p>
<p>Studies from  the same authors must be listed by date, citing the oldest study first.</p>
<p>Studies from  the same authors and same data must be distinguished by lower case letters (a  and b). Avoid in press articles.</p>
<p>All addresses  with internet links (URL) in the references must be active and lead directly to  the cited document. Inform the date the document was accessed (see examples of electronic material).</p>
<p>When the  cited document has a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) number, inform the number  and exclude the access date (see examples of electronic material).</p>
<p>Format the  references in a way that facilitates reviewing and editing. Use a line spacing  of 1.5 and font size 11. Try to include references published in the journal  Estudos de Psicologia (Campinas) to help increase its impact factor.</p>
<p>The authors  are responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of the references that have been  consulted and mentioned in the manuscript and for their content.</p>
<p>All authors cited in the text should be followed  by the publication date and listed in the references.</p>
