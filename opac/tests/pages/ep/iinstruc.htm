   <p><em>Education and Research</em> publishes only previously unpublished articles in the field of education and does not consider manuscripts concurrently submitted for publication in books or other periodicals in Brazil or abroad. Manuscripts are assessed first by the members of the editorial board. The manuscripts which do not comply with the editorial criteria of the journal are returned to their authors. The others are assessed by reviewers appointed by the editorial board. Manuscripts must be submitted via the journal's page in SciELO publishing system (<a href="http://www.scielo.org/php/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.scielo.org/php/index.php</a>).</p>
   <p> The time frame necessary for submissions to complete the review process - and be selected or rejected - varies according to the complexity of the reviews and possible changes suggested and implemented. The dates of receipt and approval of each article are stated in the published text. For each of the journal's volume, the editorial board establishes the criteria of organization of the articles approved.</p>
  <p><em>Education and Research</em> is published under the Open Access model (CC BY-NC ) therefore free for download&nbsp; and to disseminate for educational purposes. It is also free of submission charges.</p></td>

   <p><strong>Guidelines for manuscript submission</strong></p>
   <p>Upon submission of an article, authorship and the author&rsquo;s institutional affiliations must be filled out in proper spaces in SciELO System and should not be mentioned in the text, which will be submitted to blind peer review. Any references that enable reviewers to infer indirectly the authorship of the work are not accepted either. Authorship information is recorded separately, as metadata, and it is accessed only by the editors.</p>
   <p> When preparing the manuscript, the following guidelines should be followed:</p>
   <p>&bull; The manuscript can be submitted in Portuguese, Spanish or English. Articles should be  submitted in .DOC or .DOCX (Word for Windows) Times New Romanfont, 12-point font size, 1.5 line spacing. All the manuscript pages should be numbered sequentially. The body of the manuscript should have a minimum length of 35,000 and a maximum length of 50,000 characters, including spaces, references and not including the abstract.</p>
   <p>&bull;The  title of the manuscript should have no more than 15 words and  reflect its purpose and content.</p>
   <p>&bull; The abstract should contain between 200 and 250 words and describe, in an informative manner and without listing topics, the following items: general theme and research problem; objectives; methodology; main results and conclusions. It is recommended that the abstract should be written as a single paragraph, in the active voice, in the third person of the singular, in concise and affirmative sentences. The following items should be avoided: neologisms, bibliographical citations, symbols and abbreviations except those in common use, as well as formulae, equations, diagrams etc., unless absolutely necessary. The journal require an Portuguese version of the abstract along with the original text.</p>
   <p>&bull; The article should have 3 to 5 keywords.</p>
   <p>&bull; Possible acknowledgements should be cited in a footnote, and without any direct or indirect reference to the authorship.</p>
   <p>&bull; Tables, charts, graphs, and figures (photos, drawings and maps) should be numbered with Arabic numerals in the order in which they appear in the text and should include appropriate headers. Legends should appear right below each figure. Maps should contain graph scales and legends.</p>
   <p> &bull; Images must be in JPG format with 300 dpi or higher resolution and have dimensions that allow reducing or enlarging them without impairing their readability. All images must be submitted as separate files and named according to their references in the text (e.g., <em>Graph 1</em>).</p>
   <p>&bull; Explanatory footnotes can be used when necessary for understanding the text. Notes should be numbered in Arabic numerals according to the order in which they appear in the text.</p>
   <p>&bull; Citations in the text should meet the following criteria:</p>
   <p> a) quotations of up to three lines should be run in &ndash; integrated into the text in the same font size as the text - enclosed in quotation marks and be followed by the following information in parentheses: last name of the author of the quote, the year of publication and page numbers;</p>
   <p> b) quotations longer than three lines should be set off as block quotations &ndash; that is, in a new paragraph with a hanging indent of 4 cm on the left, 11 point font, without quotation marks;</p>
   <p> c) if there is no quotation, but just a reference to some work, the author&rsquo;s last name should be cited in parentheses in capital letters along with the year of publication.</p>
   <p>&bull; References must conform strictly with the technical standard NBR6023 of August 30, 2002 of the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (ABNT). Only works cited in the text should be included in the reference list, under the heading <em>References</em>, at the end of the article and on a separate page.</p>
   <p><strong>Statistical methods</strong></p>
   <p>When employed, statistical methods must be described in sufficient detail to allow a competent reader access to the original data and verification of the results presented, whilst avoiding excessively technical language and presenting results with enough clarity so as to facilitate their understanding by a non-specialized reader. This guidance to authors requires steps such as: seeking, as much as possible, to quantify the results and present them with corresponding indicators of measurement error or uncertainty (for example, confidence intervals); avoiding relying solely on statistical inference tests that convey no relevant quantitative information; discussing the eligibility of the experimentation units; supplying detailed information about randomization and about the observations; discussing the reasonableness of the results, as well as the possible limitations of the method used; specifying the software employed; restricting tables and graphics to the amount necessary to explain the foundations of the article and their robustness; avoiding tables with too many topics and duplication of data; defining statistical terms, abbreviations and symbols used in the article.</p>
   <p><strong>Guidelines on Authorship</strong></p>
   <p>Author is defined as the person who has effectively  contributed to the conceptualization of the study, the development, the  analysis and interpretation of data, as well as the final version of the text.  It is recommended that the article should have no more than four authors. In  case the article is written by more than four authors, the contribution of each  author must be detailed to the editor-in-chief and the Secretariat. If any kind  of incompatibility emerges with regard to the number of authors and the final  results presented in the article, the Editorial Committee may either question  the authors' participation or reject the manuscript submitted, at its own  discretion.   </p>
   <h3>Copyright Statement</h3>
   <p>When submitting an article for  publication in the journal <em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o e  Pesquisa</em>, the author agrees with the terms below.</p>
   <p>1) The author(s) is/are the owner of the article  copyright, but its publication in the journal automatically implies in the  integral and exclusive transfer of copyright to the journal for the first  edition of the publication, with no payment involved under the Creative Commons  Attribution Non-Commercial 3.0 Unreported CC-BY-NC 3.0, which allows the  sharing of the article provided the proper credit is given to its author(s),  and that the article is firstly published in this journal.</p>
   <p>2) The ideas  and opinions expressed in the article are the author's exclusive  responsibility, and do not necessarily reflect the journal editors' viewpoints.</p>
   <p>3) Following  the first publication of the article, the author(s) is/are allowed to sign  contracts elsewhere, in order to disseminate their article through other means  (e.g., publishing it in institutional repositories or as a chapter of a book),  provided it complies with the terms of the current license by the time of the  first publication and also that this publication includes the full citation  indicating the name of the author(s) and information about the first  publication. </p>
   <p>4) The  author(s) of a published article is/are encouraged to disseminate their work online,  always including the citations of the first edition.   </p>
   <p><strong>Research Ethics</strong></p>
   <p>Should human beings be involved in the research  (through interviews, experiments etc), the author(s) must follow the ethical  procedures established for scientific research. Unless there is specific  permission for identification, the anonymity of the participants of the  research - and, if necessary, of the institutions - must be ensured. The  authorization or the restriction to the identification must be stated by the  author(s) in an in-text note. The same principle applies to the disclosure of  images of people or institutions.   </p>
   <p><strong>Anti-plagiarism Policy</strong></p>
   <p>The articles must be original and unpublished, and  authors must make sure that all sources and references of the manuscript are  indicated. The compliance to such requirements and conditions will be  attentively checked through by the journal <em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o  e Pesquisa</em>.   </p>
   <p><strong>Originality and Plagiarism</strong></p>
   <p>Similarities between the content of the manuscript submitted with  articles and chapters of books previously published will be analyzed by the  editors-in-chief. Depending on the nature of the similarities, such analysis  may result in the initial rejection of the manuscript, if the similarities  indicate that, with regard to its theoretic and methodological basis or the  results presented, the article is not original. </p>
   <p><strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>
   <p>If the research undertaken or the publication of the  article might raise any doubts about potential conflicts of interest, the  author(s) must make a declaration stating that links to funding organizations  or commercial/political institutions have not been omitted.
