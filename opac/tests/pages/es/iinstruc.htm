  <td width="70%"><p>The journal <em>EDUCA&Ccedil;&Atilde;O &amp; SOCIEDADE (ES)</em>aims at publishing scientific and academic original papers and stimulating research and debates on the field which are focused on the relationship between education and society. Articles that are submitted for publication must be original in both print and electronic media, and simultaneous submission to another journal for evaluation is not allowed.</p>
   <p>
    The journal will accept articles written in Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, and German, as revised in their native languages. Articles in English, French, and German, once approved, should be translated into Portuguese and reviewed by the authors. Articles in Spanish will be published in the original language. In electronic publishing, foreign papers, with the exception of Spanish, will also be available in their original languages.</p>
   <p>
    Articles that are not related to the theme of the interrelationship between education and society, projects or research reports, experience reports, descriptive articles without the guiding question, chapter(s) of theses, dissertations, articles (or version thereof) already published in proceedings or national and foreign journals, either in hard copy or in digital formats <strong>shall not be accepted</strong> for publication.</p>
   <p>
    After the final approval of the Editorial Committee (EC) composed of Associate Editors, the publication of articles, critical reviews, and other works in <em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade</em>journal will materialize after the adherence of the authors as Cedes partners, as well as after the signing of the Authorship, Originality, and Copyright Transfer Agreement. Cedes partners are entitled to a year of membership, including four issues of the <em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade</em> journal, three issues of the <em>Cadernos Cedes</em>journal, be granted a discount on registration of events promoted by <em>Cedes</em>, in addition to the right to vote and to be voted.</p>
   <p>
    Authors also have the right to receive two complimentary copies of the issue in which their article was published. In case of co-authored articles, each author will receive a copy.</p>
   <p><br>
    Articles will also be fully available in electronic format on the website of the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) (www.scielo.br/es), concomitantly with the printed publication.</p>
   <p><br>
    <em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade</em> declares that the concepts and positions expressed in the published articles are the sole responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the Editorial Board of this journal.</p>
   <p>
    Authors are also responsible for the ethical conduct of research on which the article is based.</p>
   <p>
    Each author can have only one article in progress from the submission until the publication. An interval of 18 months between the publication of an article and the beginning of a new submission process by the same author will be observed.</p>
   <p>
  <strong>Authors must strictly follow the guidelines listed here, and failing may lead to the immediate rejection of the article</strong>.</p></td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
 <tr>
  <td width="15%"></td>
  <td width="70%"><p>Journal&rsquo;s editorial policy sets the following categories for evaluation of the articles: content, method, originality, relevance, theoretical consistency and analytical rigor, timeliness, quality, and alignment of the text to the editorial scope.</p>
   <p>
    There are three phases for evaluating the submitted articles. The first is the screening held by the Coordinator and Assistant Editor, examining the adequacy of the article to the editorial line of the journal and its potential for publication; the second phase is a preliminary evaluation by the EC which aims at identifying the contribution and the quality of the article for the journal; and the third phase is a double-blind peer review. The final decision returns to the EC.</p>
   <p>
    Articles considered within the scope and appropriate to the editorial criteria of the journal are submitted by the EC to the reviewers (at least two). Reviewers recommend acceptance, rejection, or reformulation of the work. In the case of a reformulation, articles should return to the reviewers for final evaluation. The result of the evaluation will be forwarded to the author.</p>
   <p>
    In the double-blind review<em>,</em>names of the reviewers are kept confidential, as well as names of the authors are omitted to the reviewers. Therefore, when submitting the article through the system, the anonymity of authorship is required<em>.</em>Under no circumstances, author(s) should be identified in the text. Any explicit reference of the authorship — citation of author(s) name(s), reference to articles authored or co-authored in previous works — are considered a break in anonymity.</p>
   <p>
    Final acceptance of articles depends on the following criteria:</p>
   <p>
    - Recommendation of the reviewers <br>
    - Execution of the necessary adjustments by the author(s)<br>
    - Approval by the Editorial Board, composed by Associate Editors, whose resolution includes five types of evaluation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> To accept.</li>
      <li> To execute required corrections.</li>
      <li> To resubmit for evaluation.</li>
      <li> To send to another journal.</li>
  <li> To reject.</li></ol></td>

Therefore, entire process of capturing and arbitration of articles is necessarily conducted by means of this electronic platform.</p>
   <p>
    Each author must register in the system and submit their work for evaluation in a double-blind method (blind review) as follows:</p>
   <ol>
      <li> Author(s) of the article should exclude names on the text, replacing them with &quot;Author&quot; and year in references and notes, instead of author names, article title, etc.</li>
      <li> In Microsoft Office documents, author&rsquo;s identification should be removed from the document properties (on the menu File &gt; Properties), by clicking on File in the main menu, followed by: File &gt; Save as &gt; Tools (or Options in Mac) &gt; Security Options &gt; Remove personal information from file to save &gt; OK &gt; Save.</li>

<table border="0" width="100%">
 <tr>
  <td width="15%"></td>
  <td width="70%"><p><em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade</em>also publishes thematic dossiers according to the scope of the journal. These can be designed from proposals or requests from the Associate Editors, from the Editorial Boards of the Journal, or from proposals from national and international academic communities.</p>
  <p>The proposed dossiers submitted by the academic community will be examined by the Editorial Board (EB) of the journal <em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade,</em> which comprises an Editor Coordinator, an Assistant Editor, and Associate Editors, which will be in charge of deciding on dossier&rsquo;s approval. Proposals that include relevant and emerging topics, covering the relationship between education and society, will be privileged.</p>
  <p>Proposals should be sent to the <em>e-mail</em> <a href="mailto:cedeseditoria@zeppelini.com.br">cedeseditoria@zeppelini.com.br</a>. Minimum requirements for the submission of proposals for thematic dossiers are the following:</p>
  <p>1. Title and summary of the proposed dossier. <br>
2. Name and curriculum summary of the dossier&rsquo;s organizer. A maximum of two organizers will be allowed per dossier. <br>
3. Subject of the study and justification. <br>
4. Dossier structure. <br>
5. List of articles that will compose the dossier, containing titles and expanded abstracts of each of them (maximum two pages each). <br>
6. Name and curriculum of the collaborators on the dossier. <br>
7. Organizer shall request the contribution of national and international experts. The dossier must have at least two international articles. <br>
8. Dossier articles must be original, that is, should not have been published in any other media, whether printed, digital or others, or be under evaluation by another journal. <br>
9. The deadline for examination of a proposed dossier by the EB is two months (maximum). At the end of the evaluation process, the organizer will receive an e-mail containing the outcome. <br>
10. If the proposal is approved, the organizer will have to ask all authors of the articles that compose the dossier to register and submit their articles for evaluation in the online SciELO system (see guidelines for submission of papers), following the dates agreed between organizer and EB, which are considered adequate for authors and editorial processing as well as for editing of the number planned for publication. <br>
11. If authors do not submit their articles, if there are any changes in the original proposal, or if deadlines are missed, without consultation and approval of the EB of <em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade,</em>the proposed dossier will be automatically eliminated. <br>
12. Approval of the dossier does not mean automatic approval of the articles contained therein. Each article will be evaluated separately, and changes or exclusions may be suggested at the end of the evaluation process. The organizer is responsible for replacing an article, within the deadlines agreed with the EB. Replacement will only occur with EB&rsquo;s approval. <br>
13. Only those dossiers that have a minimum of six articles with favorable opinions will be published. <br>
14. It is organizer&rsquo;s responsibility to monitor the editorial production of the dossier during all stages, acting, whenever requested, as an intermediary between publishers and authors of articles. <br>
15. The organizer may be author of one article of the dossier and co-author of, maximum, another article. <br>
16. The organizer will be responsible for preparing a presentation of the dossier. <br>
17. The set of articles within the dossier should have at least eight articles, following the rules for articles submission of the journal <em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade</em>.<br>
18. Omissions shall be evaluated by the EB of <em>Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade</em>journal.</p>
