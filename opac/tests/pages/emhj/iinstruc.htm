      <p>1. Papers submitted for publication must not have been published or accepted 

        for publication elsewhere. The Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office reserves 

        all rights of reproduction and republication of material that appears 

        in the <b>Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal</b> (EMHJ).</p>

      <p>2. Original papers written in Arabic, English or French may be sent for 

        consideration to the Editor-in-chief, <b>Eastern Mediterranean Health 

        Journal</b>, WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, PO Box 

        7608, Nasr City (11371), Cairo, Egypt. Papers can also be submitted by 

        email to <a href="mailto:EMHJ@emro.who.int">EMHJ@emro.who.int</a>. Papers 

        will be abstracted in all three languages.</p>

      <p>3. The subject of the paper should pertain to public health or some other 

        related technical and scientific subject within the field of interest 

        of the World Health Organization, with special reference to the Eastern 

        Mediterranean Region.</p>

      <p>4. Three copies of each manuscript should be provided. The text, together 

        with the accompanying tables and figures, should not exceed 15 double-spaced 

        typewritten or printed A4 pages (4500 words) and should be printed on 

        one side only. When the manuscript is accepted or conditionally accepted, 

        the author will be requested to submit a 3.5 inch computer diskette containing 

        the text, tables, graphs and illustrations. For English and French papers, 

        please provide the text, upon the editor&#146;s request, in both wordprocessed 

        format (we prefer Microsoft Word for the PC but can translate most other 

        formats) and also saved as a text/ASCII file. Papers submitted in Arabic 

        should follow the same guidelines as papers written in English or French. 

        If the paper is a translation of all or part of another unpublished work, 

        a copy in the original language should be submitted too. Where possible, 

        graphs should be provided in Harvard Graphics under windows or Excel, 

        and the illustrations and photographs should be provided in EPS or TIFF 

        format. However, it is necessary to provide three sets of original photographs 

        and figures with the background data. If there is any text or lettering 

        on the photographs, an additional clean set should be provided without 

        the text/lettering.</p>

      <p>5. All papers received will be peer reviewed, and on the basis of the 

        reviewer&#146;s comments, the Editorial Board reserves the right to accept 

        or reject any paper. Papers are accepted on the understanding that they 

        are subject to statistical and editorial revision as deemed necessary, 

        including abridgement of the text and omission of tabular or graphic material.</p>

      <p>6. The title of the paper should be as concise as possible, preferably 

        around 10 words, and should be placed on a separate sheet, together with 

        the full name(s) of the author(s), institutional affiliations(s) and highest 

        scientific degrees obtained. The mailing address, as well as any other 

        contact information (email address, fax, telephone) of the corresponding 

        author should be provided. The number of authors should not exceed five. 

        All authors should have made material contribution to either the design, 

        analysis or writing of the study and have approved the final version submitted. 

        Authors may be asked to verify their contribution. Other names may be 

        included in the acknowledgements.</p>

      <p>7. To facilitate the translation of abstracts and authors&#146; names, 

        authors whose mother tongue is written in Arabic characters and writing 

        in English or French should supply their full names in Arabic script and 

        provide transliterations.</p>

      <p>8. Papers reporting original research findings should follow the IMRAD 

        format: Introduction; Materials (subjects) and methods; Results; Analysis; 

        and Discussion. An abstract of no more than 100 words should be supplied, 

        clearly and briefly stating the objectives, context, results and conclusions.</p>

      <p>9. Authors should verify where appropriate that all persons on whom research 

        has been carried out have given their informed consent, and where participants 

        (living or dead) were unable to give such consent, that surrogate consent 

        was obtained.</p>

      <p>10. Review articles should contain sections dealing with objectives, 

        sources, methods of selection, compilation and interpretation of data 

        and conclusions.</p>

      <p>11. In-text citations of published works should be limited to essential 

        up-to-date references. Apart from review articles, a maximum of 25 references 

        is advisable. They should be numbered separately as they occur in the 

        text with sequential Arabic numerals in parentheses [square brackets]. 

        These references should appear in a numbered list on a separate page at 

        the end of the paper. They should contain the following elements of information 

        as appropriate: name(s) and initial(s) of author(s); title of paper or 

        book in its original language plus translation; complete name of journal 

        plus volume number and page range; name of publisher (commercial or institutional) 

        and place of publication (city and country); and date of publication. 

        Papers with inadequate references or references not arranged according 

        to these principles will be returned to the author for correction. The 

        following are examples of the Journal&#146;s preferred style:</p>

      <p><b>Book:</b></p>

      <p>Al Hamza B, Smith A. <i>The fifth sign of identity</i>. Cairo, American 

        University Press, 1990.</p>

      <p><b>Journal article:</b></p>

      <p>Jones A et al. One day in Tibet. <i>Journal of tautology</i>, 1993, 13(5):23&#150;7.</p>

      <p><b>Document:</b></p>

      <p>Al-Itneen M, ed. <i>The principles of uncertainty</i>. Geneva, World 

        Health Organization, 1985 (document WHO/DOC/537).</p>

      <p>12. Figures and tables with appropriate captions should each be on a 

        separate sheet, numbered sequentially with arabic numerals and attached 

        to the end of the paper. Each figure and table should be referred to in 

        the text and its placement in the text should be clearly indicated where 

        appropriate. Where appropriate, sources should be given for each figure 

        or table. If any figures, tables or other materials have been copied from 

        other sources, authors have the sole responsibility for securing the necessary 

        permission. In order to avoid layout problems in final production tables 

        and figures should be limited as far as possible. Not more than one table 

        or figure per 1000 words is preferable. Figures derived from data must 

        be accompanied by those data to enable redrawing if necessary.</p>

      <p>13. Original papers and diskettes will not be returned except upon request 

        by the principal author.</p>

      <p>14. On publication the authors will receive one copy each of the issue 

        in which the article appears and the principal author will receive 50 

        reprints. Requests for further reprints and pricing information may be 

        obtained from the Editor-in-Chief.</p>
