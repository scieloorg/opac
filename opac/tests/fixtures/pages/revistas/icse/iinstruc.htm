  <p><strong>Note </strong>If the manuscript is approved for publication,  all information that were excluded should be included again by the authors<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3 </strong>The maximum number of authors is limited to <strong>five</strong>. From that number it is necessary to present a justification, which will be examined by the editor. <strong>Authorship</strong> implies assuming responsibility publicly for the content of the text submitted for publication.

  <p><strong>6</strong> Manuscripts referring to research with human beings must include information on the approval by an Ethics Committee in the area, according to Resolution no. 466/13 of Brazil&rsquo;s National Health Council, or  Resolution No. 510/2016, which deals with the ethical specificities of research  in the Human and Social Sciences. Only the process number must be informed, presenting it in the body of  the text, at the end of the section on methodology. <strong>This  number should be kept in the final version of the manuscript if it is approved  for publication</strong>.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 <strong>7 </strong>Images, figures or drawings must be in tiff or jpeg format, with minimum resolution of 300 dpi, size of 16 x 20 cm, caption, and 9-point Arial font.

  <p><strong>8</strong> Interface adopts the Vancouver system for the style of citations and references in its manuscripts.</p>
  <p><strong>CITATIONS AND REFERENCES</strong> <br>
    Starting in 2014,&nbsp;the journal Interface is changing over to the Vancouver standard as the style to use for citations and references in manuscripts submitted. They should not be entered  in automatic mode, nor as a cross-reference. </p>
<p> <strong>CITATIONS IN THE TEXT</strong> <br>
   Citations should be numbered consecutively, according to the order in which they are presented in the text. They should be identified by superscript Arabic  numbers.</p>
  <p>    <strong>Example</strong>:<br>
    According to Teixeira<sup>1</sup><br>
    <br>
    According to Schraiber<sup>2</sup> ...</p>
<p><strong>Specific cases of citations</strong>:<br>
    <strong>1</strong> Reference with more than two authors: in the body of the text, only the name of the first author should be cited, followed by the expression &quot;et al.&quot;<br>
    <strong>2</strong> Literal citations: These should be inserted in the paragraph between quotation marks (Double  quotation marks), and accompanied by the citation page in parentheses, with the  point at the end.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> <br>
Starting from this relation, we can affirm that the nature of educational work  corresponds to &quot;[...] the act of producing, directly and intentionally, in  each singular individual, the humanity produced historically and collectively  by all men&quot; 2 (p. 13).<strong></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Notes</strong><br>
    If the quote comes with double quotation  marks in the original text, replace them by the apostrophe or single quotation  marks. </p>
  <p><strong>Example</strong>:&nbsp;<br>
    &quot;The 'Uniform Requirements' (Vancouver style) are largely based on the style standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), adapted by the NLM&rdquo;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;(p.  47).</p>
  <p>At the end of a  quote the punctuation mark will be inside the quotation marks if the sentence  begins and ends with quotation marks.<br>
    <strong><br>
    Example:<br>
      </strong>&quot;We are, therefore,  in a context where, as Gramsci said, it is a struggle between the new who wants  to be born and the old man who does not want to leave the scene.&quot; 9  (p.149)<br>
    When the phrase  is not complete within the quotation marks, the punctuation should be outside  the quotation marks.<br>
  <strong><br>
  Example:<br>
</strong>In CFM's view, &quot;there  has never been such a violent aggression against the category and against the  assistance offered to the population&quot; (p.3). </p>
  <p><strong>3</strong> Literal citation of&nbsp;<strong>more than three lines</strong>: in a paragraph inset from the text (with a one-line space before and after it), with <strong> cm</strong>&nbsp;indentation on the left side,&nbsp;without  quotation marks, and accompanied by the citation page in parentheses (after the  citation punctuation). </p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> <br>
    This meeting has expanded and evolved into the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), and has established the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Presented to Biomedical Journals: the Vancouver Style&nbsp;2. <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(p.  42)</p>
  <p><strong>Note<br>
    Citation fragment in text<br>
  </strong>- use bracket: [...] we found some flaws in  the system [...] when we re-read the manuscript, but nothing could be done  [...]. </p>
<p> <strong>REFERENCES </strong>(Transcribed and adapted from Pizzani L, Silva RC,  Feb 2014; Jeorgina GR, 2008)<br>
   All the authors cited in the text should appear among the references listed at the end of the manuscript, in numerical order, following the general standards of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>). The names of the journals should be abbreviated in accordance with the style used in Index Medicus (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/</a>).<br>
   The references should be aligned only with the left margin and, so as to identify the document, with single spacing and separated from each other by a double space.<br>
   The punctuation should follow the international standards and should be uniform for all the references:&nbsp;<br>
   Leave one space after a full stop/period.&nbsp;<br>
   Leave one space after a semicolon.&nbsp;<br>
   Leave one space after a colon.&nbsp;<br>
   When the reference occupies more than one line, restart in the first position.</p>

Manuscripts that focus on issues of local interest only and present essentially descriptive approaches to the problem should be avoided.</p>
  <p><strong>8</strong> The author can indicate one referee (from Brazil or abroad) to evaluate his/her manuscript. If it is necessary, he/she should also inform about researchers with whom there may be conflicts of interest arising from the article.</p>
  <p><strong>MANUSCRIPTS EVALUATION AND PUBLICATION OF APPROVED ORIGINALS</strong></p>
  <p>Interface adopts the  strict editorial policy of peer review. Every manuscript  submitted to Interface undergoes an  initial screening to ensure it is within the journal's scope and to identify issues in  submission and documentation,  including identification of plagiarism and self-plagiarism. The submission  will only be confirmed if it complies with all the  Interface standards and when all the requested documents are inserted in the  system. This analysis  is completed by the associated editors and editors and only follows for peer  review the texts that:<br>
    &nbsp;- meet the minimum requisites of a  scientific paper and comply with the journal&rsquo;s scope;<br>
- have relevance and present original issues and results and adequacy of  theoretical-methodological approach.</p>
  <p><strong> Peer review: </strong>the text whose submission was confirmed advance to double-blind peer review and is evaluated by, at least, two referees. The material is returned to the author in case the referees suggest minor changes and/or corrections. In this case, there will be a second round of evaluation of the revised manuscript.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Notes</strong><br>    
    In case of divergence of opinions, the text is sent to a new third referee for arbitration.<br>
    The Editorial Board (editors and associate editors) is responsible for the final decision about the manuscript&rsquo;s scientific merit. }<br>
    The Interface Editorial Board may adopt, in  special situations, the fast track peer review. This procedure aims to give a  faster visibility to submitted manuscripts whose  contributions are considered relevant and have priority for the scientific  community of the journal scope area. </p>
  <p><strong>3 Approved manuscript edition:</strong> once the manuscript has been approved, the authors receive a  correspondence with specific guidelines on sending the final version of the  text, to begin the editing process for publication (layout, desktop  publishing and XML Markup). These guidelines include:</p>
  <p>- updating the complete  data of the author (s), confirming the institutional link or professional  occupation, as already indicated <strong>in item  3 of SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS</strong>;<br>
    <br>
    - final revision of the  text, including title, keywords, citations and references, and abstracts  (Portuguese, English and Spanish) by specialized professionals indicating, with  another font color, the corrections made in this latest version;<br>
    <br>
    - in the case of a  manuscript with two or more authors, insert in this final version of the text, <strong>before the</strong> <strong>References</strong>, the item <strong>Collaborators</strong>,  specifying the individual responsibilities of each one in the production of the  manuscript, including at least the following minimum authorship criteria:<br>
    <br>
    1) having participated actively in the  discussion of the results;<br>
    2) having participated in the review and  approval of the text&rsquo;s final version;<br>
    <br>
    - in case of thanks to  people or institutions, insert them also in the final version of the text,  before the References, in the item Acknowledgments.<br>
    <br>
    The manuscript editing process includes the  layout, desktop  publishing and XML Markup and revision of the material by the Interface technical team and the  approval of the manuscript by the authors.<br>
All approved articles are published in a  pre-publication (ahead of print) flow in the SciELO collection, already with a  DOI number, allowing them to be available on this basis for consultation and,  thus, can be cited, even before they are published in the corresponding  Journal&rsquo;s issue .<br>
The texts are the responsibility of the  authors, not necessarily coinciding with the point of view of the journal&rsquo;s  Editorial Board.</p>
  <p><strong><br>
    Note</strong><br>
    If the authors are  interested in publishing their manuscript in English, they should express this interest and immediately contact the  Journal's Office for information on deadlines, costs, contact with accredited  professionals, etc. These expenses shall be borne entirely by the authors.
