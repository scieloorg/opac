      <td width="70%"><p>The <strong><em>Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research</em></strong> publishes original research articles of outstanding scientific significance. Manuscripts must be submitted in English. We will consider manuscripts of any length; we encourage the submission of both substantial full-length bodies of work and shorter manuscripts that report novel findings that might be based on a limited number of experiments. The key criteria are that the research clearly demonstrates its novelty, its importance to a particular field as well as its interest to those outside that discipline, and conclusions that are justified by the data.</p>

<p><b>Authorship requirements</b></p>
<p>Only those persons who contributed directly to the intellectual content of the paper should be listed as authors. Authors should meet all of the following criteria, thereby allowing persons named as authors to take public responsibility for the content of the paper.</p>
<ul><li>Conceived, planned and carried out the experiments that led to the paper or interpreted the data it presents, or both.</li>
<li>Wrote the paper, or reviewed successive versions.</li>
<li>Approved the final version.<br>
Holding positions of administrative leadership, contributing patients, and collecting and assembling data, however important to the research, are not by themselves criteria for authorship. Other persons who have made substantial, direct contributions to the work but cannot be considered authors should be cited in the Acknowledgment section, with their permission, and a description of their specific contributions to the research should be given.</ul>
 
<p><b>Cover Letter </b></p>
<p>It is important that you include a cover letter with your manuscript. Take the time to consider why this manuscript is suitable for publication in the <em>Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research</em>. Why will your paper inspire the other members of your field, and how will it drive research forward? Please explain this in your cover letter.</p> 
<p>The cover letter should also contain the following information:</p>
<ul><li>Title of article.</li>
<li>Name(s) of all author(s).</li>
<li>Name, complete mailing address, including zip code, telephone number, fax number and e-mail of author to whom correspondence should be sent.</li>
<li>If a version of the manuscript has been previously submitted for publication to another journal, include comments from the peer reviewers and indicate how the authors have responded to these comments.</li>
<li>Papers in the area of Clinical Investigation should include a statement indicating that the protocol has been approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee (Hospital with which at least one of the authors is associated) and that written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This information must also be cited in the Material and Methods section of the manuscript.</li></ul>
 
<p><b>Text format </b></p>

<ul><li>The text of a manuscript can only be accepted as a Microsoft Word file created with MS Word as a "doc", "docx" or "rtf" document.</li>
<li>Each page should contain the page number in the upper right-hand corner starting with the title page as page 1.</li>
<li>Report all measurements in Syst&egrave;me International, SI (<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/" target="_blank">http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units</a>) and standard units where applicable (see below).</li>
<li>Do not use abbreviations in the title and limit their use in the abstract and text.</li>
<li>The length of the manuscript and the number of tables and figures must be kept to a minimum.</li>
<li>Ensure that all references are cited in the text.</li>
<li>Generic names must be used for all drugs. Instruments may be referred to by proprietary name; the name and country or electronic address of the manufacturer should be given in parentheses in the text.

</ul>
 
<p>The <em>Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research</em> follows the reference format of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, which can be found on the website of the National Library of Medicine (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/</a>). </p> 
<p>The writing style should be concise and accessible. Editors will make suggestions for how to achieve this, as well as suggestions for cuts or additions that could be made to the article to strengthen the argument. Our aim is to make the editorial process rigorous and consistent, but not intrusive or overbearing. Authors are encouraged to use their own voice and to decide how best to present their ideas, results, and conclusions.
</p> 
<p>Although we encourage submissions from around the globe, we require that manuscripts be submitted in American English. As a step towards overcoming language barriers, we encourage authors to seek the assistance of <a href="http://bjournal.com.br/" target="_blank">professional services available on the homepage of the journal/Service and Information</a>.</p>

 
<p><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p>Text footnotes, if unavoidable, should be numbered consecutively in superscript in the manuscript and written on a separate page following the abstract.
</p> 

<p><b>Abbreviations </b></p>

<p>Abbreviations should be kept to a minimum. Define all abbreviations upon first use in the abstract and the text. Non-standard abbreviations should not be used unless they appear at least three times in the text.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain all abbreviations in the abstract, text, figure and table legends <strong>when they first appear</strong>. Keep the number of abbreviations to a minimum.</li>
<li>Do not explain abbreviations for units of measurement [3 mL, not 3 milliliters (mL)] or standard scientific symbols [Na, not sodium (Na)].</li>
<li>Abbreviate long names of chemical substances and terms for therapeutic combinations. Abbreviate names of tests and procedures that are better known by their abbreviations than by the full name (VDRL test, SMA-12).</li>
<li>Use abbreviations in figures and tables to save space, but they <strong>must be defined in the legend</strong>.</li></ul>
 

<p><b>Nomenclature </b></p>
vThe use of standardized nomenclature in all fields of science and medicine is an essential step toward the integration and linking of scientific information reported in published literature. We will enforce the use of correct and established nomenclature wherever possible:
We strongly encourage the use of <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/" target="_blank">SI units</a>.
</p>

<ul><li>s for second</li>
<li>min for minute</li>
<li>h for hour</li>
<li>L for liter</li>
<li>m for meter</li>
<li>kDa for mass in kilodaltons</li>
<li>5 mM rather than <sup>5</sup> x 10-3 M or 0.005 M</li></ul>
 
<p>Species names (e.g.,<em> Homo sapiens</em>), genes, mutations, genotypes, and alleles should be italicized. Use the recommended name by consulting the appropriate genetic nomenclature database, e.g., HUGO for human genes. It is sometimes advisable to indicate the synonyms for the gene the first time it appears in the text.</p>
 
<p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/medicines/services/inn/en/" target="_blank">Recommended International Non-Proprietary Name (rINN)</a> of drugs should be provided.</p></td>

<p><b>Review article</b></p>
<p>A review article should provide a synthetic and critical analysis of a relevant area and should not be merely a chronological description of the literature. A review article by investigators who have made substantial contributions to a specific area in medical and biological sciences will be published by invitation of the Editors. However, an outline of a review article may be submitted to the Editors without prior consultation. If it is judged appropriate for the Journal, the author(s) will be invited to prepare the article for peer review. A minireview is focused on a restricted part of a subject normally covered in a review article.

<p><b>Title Page</b><br>
<b>Title</b> - The title should be as short and informative as possible, should not contain non-standard acronyms or abbreviations, and should not exceed two printed lines.<br>

<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Since abstracts are published separately by Information Services, they should contain sufficient hard data, to be appreciated by the reader. The <i>Brazilian Journal</i> publishes <b>unstructured abstracts</b> in a single paragraph. The abstract should not exceed 250 words.</p>

<p>The abstract should briefly and clearly present the objective, experimental approach, new results as quantitative data if possible, and conclusions. It should mention the techniques used without going into methodological detail and mention the most important results.
</p>
 
<p>Abbreviations should be kept to a minimum and should be defined in both the Abstract and text.<br>
Please do not include any reference citations in the abstract. If the use of a reference is unavoidable, the full citation should be given within the abstract.</p>
 
<p>Please see &lt;<a href="http://bjournal.com.br/writing_a_good_abstract.html" target="_blank">http://www.bjournal.com.br/writing_a_good_abstract.html</a>&gt;  for suggestions on writing a good abstract </p>
<p><b>Key Words </b><br>
A list of key words or indexing terms (no more than 6) should be included. A capital letter should be used for the first letter of each key word, separated by a semicolon. The Journal recommends the use of medical subject headings of Index Medicus for key words to avoid the use of several synonyms as entry terms in the index for different papers on the same subject. Remember, key words are used by the Scielo Database (see <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_serial&pid=0100-879X&lng=en&nrm=iso" target="_blank">http://www.scielo.br/bjmbr</a>;articles search/subject) to index published articles. </p>
 
<p><b>Running title</b><br>
This short title, to be used as a page heading, should not exceed 60 letters and spaces.</p>   

<p><b>Corresponding author</b><br>
One of the authors should be designated as the corresponding author. It is the corresponding author’s responsibility to ensure that the author list is accurate and complete. If the article has been submitted on behalf of a consortium, all consortium members and affiliations should be listed in the Acknowledgments section.
Provide the name and email address of the author to whom correspondence should be sent.</p>  

<p><b>Introduction </b><br>
The Introduction should put the focus of the manuscript into a broader context. As you compose the Introduction, think of readers who are not experts in this field. This should state the purpose of the investigation and justification for undertaking the research and relationship to other work in the field. An extensive listing or review of the literature should not be used. If there are relevant controversies or disagreements in the field, they should be mentioned so that a non-expert reader can delve into these issues further. The Introduction should conclude with a brief statement of the overall aim of the experiments and a comment about what was achieved.
</p> 


<p><b>Material and Methods </b><br>
Sufficient information should be provided in the text or by referring to papers in generally available journals to permit the work to be repeated.<br>
This section should provide enough detail for reproduction of the findings. Protocols for new methods should be included, but well-established protocols may simply be referenced. We encourage authors to submit, as separate files, detailed protocols for newer or less well-established methods. These will be linked to the article and will be fully accessable.
 </p>

<p><b>Results</b><br>
The results should be presented clearly and concisely. Tables and figures should be used only when necessary for effective comprehension of the data. The Results section should provide results of all of the experiments that are required to support the conclusions of the paper. There is no specific word limit for this section, but a description of experiments that are peripheral to the main message of the article and that detract from the focus of the article should not be included. The section may be divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading. Large datasets, including raw data, should be submitted as supplementary files; these are published online linked to the article. The Results section should be written in past tense. In some situations, it may be desirable to combine Results and Discussion into a single section.
</p> 


<p><b>Discussion</b><br>
The purpose of the Discussion is to identify new and relevant results and relate them to existing knowledge. Information given elsewhere in the text, especially in Results, may be cited but all of the results should not be repeated in detail in the Discussion. The Discussion should spell out the major conclusions and interpretations of the work including some explanation of the significance of these conclusions. How do the conclusions affect the existing assumptions and models in the field? How can future research build on these observations? What are the key experiments that must be done? The Discussion should be concise and tightly argued. If warranted, the Results and Discussion may be combined into one section.
</p> 


<p><b>Acknowledgments </b><br>
When appropriate, briefly acknowledge technical assistance, advice and contributions from colleagues. People who contributed to the work, but do not fit the criteria for authors should be listed in the Acknowledgments section, along with their contributions. Donations of animals, cells, or reagents should also be acknowledged You must also ensure that anyone named in the Acknowledgments agrees to being so named. Financial support for the research and fellowships should be acknowledged in this section (agency and grant number).
 </p> 


<p><b>Figures</b><br>
Figures must be submitted in high-resolution version (600 dpi).
<p>Please ensure that the files conform to our Guidelines for Figure Preparation when preparing your figures for production and/or "Image Quality Specifications". The link contains important information about image quality from PubMed Central where the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research is indexed.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research requires the same quality as PubMed Central. Please follow these instructions when you submit figures to the Brazilian Journal.</p>
 
<p><b>Preparing figure files for submission</b><br>
The <i>Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research</i> encourages authors to use figures where this will increase the clarity of an article. The use of color figures in articles is free of charge. The following guidelines must be observed when preparing figures. Failure to do so is likely to delay acceptance and publication of the article.
</p> 


<ul><li>Each figure of a manuscript should be submitted as a single file.</li>
<li>Figures should be numbered in the order they are first mentioned in the text, and uploaded in this order.</li>
<li>Figure titles and legends should be provided in the main manuscript, not in the graphic file.</li>
<li>The aim of the figure legend should be to describe the key messages of the figure, but the figure should also be discussed in the text.</li>
<li>An enlarged version of the figure and its full legend will often be viewed in a separate window online, and it should be possible for a reader to understand the figure without moving back and forth between this window and the relevant parts of the text.
<li>Each legend should have a concise title of no more than 15 words. The legend itself should be succinct, while still explaining all symbols and abbreviations. Avoid lengthy descriptions of methods. Statistical information should be given as well as the statistical tests used.
<li>Arrows or letters should be used in the figure and explained in the legend to identify important structures.
<li>Figures with multiple panels should use capital letters A, B, C, etc. to identify the panels.
<li>Each figure should be closely cropped to minimize the amount of white space surrounding the illustration. Cropping figures improves accuracy when placing the figure in combination with other elements, when the accepted manuscript is prepared for publication. 
<li>Individual figure files should not exceed 5 MB. If a suitable format is chosen, this file size is adequate for extremely high quality figures.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>

<p>Please note that it is the responsibility of the author(s) to obtain permission from the copyright holder to reproduce figures (or tables) that have previously been published elsewhere. In order for all figures to be open-access, authors must have permission from the rights holder if they wish to include images that have been published elsewhere in non-open-access journals. Permission should be indicated in the figure legend, and the original source included in the reference list.
 </p>

<p><b>Tables</b></p>

<li>Tables must be submitted in Word (.doc) or Excel (.xls), not as an image.</li>
<li>Tables must be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals in the text.</li>
<li>Tables must have a concise and descriptive title.</li>
<li>All explanatory information should be given in a footnote below the table. Footnotes should be used to explain abbreviations and provide statistical information, including statistical tests used.</li>

<li>Tables in Excel must be cell-based; do not use picture elements, text boxes, tabs, or returns in tables.</li>


<p><b>References</b></p> 
<p>Only published or accepted manuscripts should be included in the reference list. Meeting abstracts, conference talks, or papers that have been submitted but not yet accepted should not be cited. Limited citation of unpublished work should be included in the body of the text only. All personal communications should be supported by a letter from the relevant authors. Authors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of their references and for correct text citation. When possible, references which are easily available in English should be cited.
</p>

<p>The BJMBR uses the numbered citation (citation-sequence) method. References are listed and numbered in the order that they appear in the text. In the text, citations should be indicated by the reference number in parentheses. Multiple citations within a single set of parentheses should be separated by commas without a space (1,5,7) . Where there are 3 or more sequential citations, they should be given as a range (4-9).
</p>

<p>Because all references will be linked electronically (doi), if possible, to the papers they cite, proper formatting of the references is crucial. For all references, <b>list the first 6 authors</b> followed by et al., Title of article, Journal (abbreviation), Year, Volume, Complete Pages,
The <i>Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research</i> follows the reference format of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, which can be found on the website of the National Library of Medicine (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html</a>). Use the Medline journal abbreviations and follow the reference style shown on the Website noted above, with several exceptions. See below for details. If the author uses the program "Reference Manager", copy the file containing the <a href="http://bjournal.com.br/Brazilian%20Journal%20of%20Medical%20and%20Biological%20Research.zip">style of the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research</a> and place it in the folder of "Styles".

The Editors encourage submission of manuscripts defining cell biology as an area of convergence of several other research fields, especially manuscripts providing insights into the cellular basis of immunology, neurobiology, microbial pathology, developmental biology, and disease.
